##### Bio 

As Executive Director of the Palouse Basin Aquifer Committee (PBAC), Mike Faupel works with cities, counties, and universities to ensure a long-term, quality water supply for the Palouse Basin region which serves as the sole source of drinking water across portions of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. Prior to working with PBAC Mike served as Chief Administrative Officer for The Sustainability Consortium and was a founding Board of Directors member and President of the Illinois River Watershed Partnership.

When he's not promoting beneficial uses and conservation of water resources Mike can usually be found engaged in some form of water-based recreation such as boating, fishing or snow sports.

##### Presentations

- **Tackling Idaho's Healthcare Workforce Needs: Geospatial Insights to Guide Next Steps**, Yesol Sapozhnikov (Idaho Office of Underserved and Rural Medical Research, School of Health and Medical Professions, University of Idaho) -- ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Idaho is a tele-education program that offers expert training and peer support for providers in rural and frontier communities. We will present how IOURMR researchers analyzed the program enrollment data using GIS tools to evaluate participation patterns and identify regions that need more outreach and engagement. The research team consists of Yesol Sapozhnikov, Cassandra Leonard, Nicholas Coombs (remote), and Madeline Casanova (remote).
- **Using GIS & Remote Sensing Data to Assess Crop Yield**, Sarah Olson (Soil & Water Systems, University of Idaho) -- Through an ongoing research project for the Coeur D'Alene Tribe, we are attempting to determine whether evapotranspiration (ET) is a useful metric for evaluating crop yield. Using remote sensing data, we aim to create a model using ET that can predict whether a field's yield is 'productive' or 'unproductive,' so land managers from the Tribe can target areas for environmental management. (presenting via Zoom)
- **City LLMs: computational urban planning of tomorrow**, Gil Rezin (Computer Science, Washington State University) -- An insight into the future of urban planning and land use modelling from the perspective of AI researchers, particularly through the usage of Large Language Models. Through transformer and diffusion models, the urban planning process has the potential to be transformed, reducing labor intensity while increasing municipal efficiency and community input. (presenting via Zoom)

##### Presentations

- **Annexation Action: Streamlining Tax Code Administration in Idaho with GIS**, Paul Reyes (Idaho State Tax Commission) -- This presentation explains how the Idaho State Tax Commission leverages GIS technology for managing tax code areas and taxing district annexations to ensure accurate property tax assessment and collection statewide. By following clearly defined steps, the ISTC maintains compliance, prevents jurisdictional overlap, and provides timely updates to all parties. The ISTC's GIS team works closely with counties and supports their cadastral mapping efforts and the effective visualization of their parcels.
- **StoryMap to share successes of the USDA-ARS Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network**, Alycia Bean (Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State University) -- The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network is a USDA_ARS flagship initiative comprising 19 research sites, over 20 interdisciplinary working groups, and more than 700 active participants. Together, we advance integrated, stakeholder-informed science that addresses pressing challenges in agricultural sustainability. Example of ESRI StoryMap to highlight our successes.
- **Locavores, Foodsheds, and Food Futures: An Almanac for the Palouse**, Dan Cronan (Design and Construction, Washington State University) -- The project explores how geospatial storytelling and community-based mapping can help visualize the relationships between local food systems, land use, and climate resilience across the Palouse region. This project uses GIS visualization tools to prototype a digital almanac which featuring pilot sites and work from organizations like Koppel Farm, City of Pullman's Environmental Resilience Commission, and local community gardens that connects data, narratives, and design to envision a more sustainable and self-reliant regional foodshed.

12:40 pm - 1:25 pm,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","GIS at the Crossroads: Building Data-Driven Freight Solutions for Pullman and Whitman County","Melissa Cleveland and Cody Hodgson (Welch Comer Engineering)",Invited presentation,"The Pullman-Whitman County Freight Alternatives Study, completed in 2025 for the Palouse Regional Transportation Planning Organization, used GIS analysis to identify practical freight corridors that could divert heavy truck traffic away from downtown Pullman, Washington. This presentation explores how GIS tools enabled data-driven collaboration among regional partners in both Washington and Idaho.Presenters will discuss the process of layering spatial data, travel modeling, and public feedback to rank alternative freight routes, as well as how GIS visualization strengthened community understanding and consensus. Attendees will gain insight into replicable techniques for multi-jurisdictional freight studies, integrating GIS analytics into route evaluation, and effectively communicating technical findings to non-technical audiences.

##### Presentations

- **Integrating GIS, LiDAR, and AI Tools for Quality of Individual Tree Segmentation**, Edward Flathers (College of Natural Resources Forest Innovations Institute, University of Idaho) -- LiDAR has become a more common tool for forest inventory, and as LiDAR technology has advanced, data resolution has increased to allow for identification of individual trees in forests. Algorithms attempt to segment individual trees from LiDAR point clouds with varying levels of success. How can we measure the quality of segmentation and provide a quantitative confidence for individual tree inventory?
- **Beet Leafhopper Abundance Interpolation: Classical Methods vs. Model-Based Approaches with Spatial and Spatiotemporal Evaluation**, Fereshteh Namdari (University of Idaho) -- This talk compares classical spatial interpolation (IDW, kriging) with model-based and spatiotemporal approaches to estimate and forecast beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus) abundance in the Columbia Basin. We test whether adding time (week) improves next-week predictions and present risk maps highlighting likely pressure hotspots to support targeted pest management. (presenting via Zoom)
