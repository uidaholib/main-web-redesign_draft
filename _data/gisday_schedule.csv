##### Presentations

- *Aerial Timelapse Tool Survey*, Andrew Weymouth (Library, University of Idaho) -- This presentation will explore tools for creating aerial time lapses, ranging from beginner friendly platforms like ArcGIS World Imagery Wayback to more advanced technical workflows using JavaScript and expansive datasets in Google Earth Engine. Weâ€™ll discuss image mosaicking, exporting results, visualization considerations and overall image fidelity.
- *The best way to learn GIS*, Edwin DeYoung (GIS Help) -- There is a lot to learn to be successful in a GIS position. What is the best way to gain these skills?
- *Keeping Watch: Using GIS to assess conservation tillage practices and crop rotation on crop performance in Whitman County under drought and heat stress using remote sensing*, Samiha Suhrah Ali (Soil and Water Systems, University of Idaho) -- Crop insurance payments are crucial for farmers in the US and Washington, as they cover crop loss due to extreme weather events. The federal government and RMA subsidize the insurance program. If evidence shows progressive growers adopting conservation measures are more resilient, insurance premiums could be reduced, reducing expenses and encouraging widespread adoption.
- *Appraising Rural Real Estate using LandValue Solutions integrated GIS Mapping*, Ruby Miles Stroschein (LandValue Solutions) -- GIS mapping plays a crucial role in appraising farmland, timberland, and special projects by providing spatial data on land boundaries, soil quality, and topography. These tools enable precise assessments for conservation easement and eminent domain road project appraisals, ensuring informed data for accurate analysis.
- *Integrating Computer Science with GIS: A Practical Approach from My Internship at Esri*, Shashwot Niraula (Computer Science, University of Idaho) -- In this talk, I'll share journal as a CS student to GIS, including my hands-on experiences from my internship at Esri, where I applied Computer Science principles to GIS. I'll cover how I utilized Google Colab for spatial analysis, demonstrating key projects and workflows I developed, and discuss how these practices can be used to enhance geospatial applications. I'll also link to essential resources, including tutorials I've created on [Esri's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuhleKMdSSQ&list=PL0VMTWv3XRwX_mFSqOOeuFZJbNUbkswD3&pp=iAQB) and my [post on the ArcGIS Blog](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/api-python/developers/get-started-with-arcgis-api-for-python-in-google-colab/).

##### Panel

- **Danielle Favreau** -- Danielle Favreau is the Water Resources Information Section Manager at the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) where she has been supporting GIS activities since 2005. Over the last 19 years she participated in IDWR's transition from Esri's ArcView 3.3 to ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap) and now to ArcGIS Pro. Mrs. Favreau has been a Certified GIS Professional (GISP) since 2008. She also has a Bachelor of Science from the University of California at Davis and a GIS Certificate from Boise State University. An active participant in the GIS community, Mrs. Favreau is the Idaho Hydrography Technical Working Group Chair, attends the Geodetic Control Technical Working Group, served as NR URISA Board Member and 2013 Intermountain GIS Conference Chair and is a long-time participant of the City of Boise's Map Mania.

Learn why the skills of a GIS professional are vital to ensuring accurate, real-time data for emergency response, and how you could make a difference in saving lives and protecting property.
- *The NW GIS User Group*, Sam Jenkins (NW GIS User Group & City of Pullman) -- In this presentation, I will introduce the NW GIS User Group, highlighting its role in fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among GIS professionals in the Pacific Northwest. We'll explore how the group supports skill development, networking, and the adoption of geospatial technologies through conferences, events, workshops, and resources.
- *Utilizing ESRIs Application Suite to Dynamically Collect and Report Environmental Sampling Data*, Manda Wood (Alta Science & Engineering, Inc.) -- Under contract to Idaho DEQ, Alta Science and Engineering, Inc. sampled recreational locations around Coeur d'Alene Lake and the Spokane River for metals. Sampling followed specific protocols and included wet and dry sediments, soils, and water.  Alta will present why and how we used ArcGIS Pro, Field Maps on mobile devices, and Experience Builder for real-time sampling updates allowing for timely QA/QC feedback. Susan Spalinger will be an additional presenter for this talk.
- *Defining Deep Soil and Soil Carbon Vulnerability using GIS*, Gabrielle Feber (Environmental Science, University of Idaho) -- Soil is largely understudied, especially deep soil, and deep soil holds a substantial amount of carbon. GIS data can be used to define deep soil and soil carbon vulnerability by exploring the depth of understudied soil and amount of soil organic carbon in the U.S.
