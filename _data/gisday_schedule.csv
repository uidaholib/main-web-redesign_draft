Our work should promulgate a reading of place that acknowledges the complex cultural, ecological, and biochemical processes taking place above, below, and within the urban ground. In this talk, I'll share my experiences in teaching, analyzing, and designing patterns of living, stewarding, and connection. Using examples from my work on the NWF Urban Wildlife Connectivity Study, the Upper LA River and Tributaries Plan, and Destination Crenshaw, the talk will highlight what happens ""behind the scenes"" - the messy process of collaborative design, analysis techniques, and community narratives. 

**Presenter Bio**

Jean Yang is a landscape designer, urban planner, and educator focused on design-driven, equity-focused, and benefits-based landscapes. A Senior Associate at Studio-MLA and Visiting Faculty Fellow in Design for Spatial Justice at the University of Oregon, Yang has analyzed, designed, and fought for public space in historically challenged areas. Her projects include Destination Crenshaw - is a 1.3 mile–long open-air museum dedicated to preserving the history and culture of African American, the Upper LA River and Tributaries plan - which will provide new and enhanced open spaces to over a million people, and the LA County Parks and Recreation Strategic Plan, which aligns one of the largest landowners in Los Angeles with the fight for justice and equity. Yang has received Azure Award for Urban Design Vision, the Southern California ASLA Merit Award, and the ASLA Honor Award."

- **Remote sensor comparison for long-term riparian habitat monitoring**, Tarita Harju (Alta Science & Engineering) -- Alta Science & Engineering is conducting a pilot project that compares multiple sensors to determine their suitability for long-term riparian habitat monitoring at a local level.  We collected UAS-based Laser Scanner [LiDAR], 5-band multi-spectral imagery, high resolution RGB imagery, as well as Terrestrial Laser Scanner data.  Data from each sensor are compared against one another in their ability to calculate riparian vegetation cover, height, density, greenness, and other important riparian characteristics such as open water and floodplain profile. Partners include Clark County Desert Conservation Program, and Aridlands LLC.
- **Food access and environment of vulnerable populations in the Treasure Valley, Idaho**, Julie Hurdman (Geography and Geological Sciences, University of Idaho) -- Blending the popular research topics of food deserts and swamps, we examine if vulnerable populations in the Boise Metropolitan Area are more likely to have ready access to nutrition-poor, calorie-dense foods."

Framing the discussion, they will introduce preliminary work on [""Stories of Fire: A Pacific Northwest Climate Justice Atlas""](https://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2021-spring/011421-confluencelab), a community based, multimodal atlas that gathers, tracks and maps stories and images of wildfire, especially those that foreground connections between fire, social/environmental justice and traditionally underrepresented rural voices. The session will explore their approach to narrative cartography as it relates to the larger [Pacific Northwest Just Futures Institute for Racial and Climate Justice](https://cef.uoregon.edu/pnw-just-futures-institute/)."
1:45 pm - 2:10 pm,"Vandal Ballroom and Zoom","Mapping for Resilience: A storymap about using lidar to address Idaho's challenges","Tara Pozzi (Environmental Policy and Behavior, UC Davis)<br><em><small>Presenting virtually</small></em>","Invited special topics presentation","Idaho will have publicly-available lidar data and lidar-derived products for 73% of the state by the end of 2021. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technology that provides high-resolution elevation data. With the influx of new data, there are many opportunities for local communities to use this information for natural hazard management, strategic development, and conservation, among other applications. The [Storymap](https://boisestate.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=63fc0118b554441589d7793e1c38ff1d) blends texts and visuals to explore lidar acquisition and implementation in Idaho. This information is intended for anyone that may want to use lidar or already uses lidar including GIS technicians, planners, engineers, academics, and artists, among others. As a compilation of stories from Idahoans representing various government agencies and academic institutions, this Storymap gives background on how lidar works, its applications in Idaho, and instructions/resources on how to acquire lidar. We hope this is a place for Idahoans to learn about the usability of lidar and be inspired to use it towards forming a resilient Idaho.

We'll explore some climate stories with the tool. 
- **Using GIS tools to track Sagebrush plant community resiliency**, Georgia Harrison (Plant Sciences, University of Idaho) -- A demonstration of using Google Earth Engine within Python to access rangeland plant cover data from the rangelands analysis platform (rangelands.app). We will track plant cover and assess how it has changed over time.
