The Palouse Basin Aquifer Committee monitors and reports on water usage, and is working to provide long-term and high quality water sources to the region.

##### Bio 

As Executive Director of the Palouse Basin Aquifer Committee (PBAC), Mike Faupel works with cities, counties, and universities to ensure a long-term, quality water supply for the Palouse Basin region which serves as the sole source of drinking water across portions of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. Prior to working with PBAC Mike served as Chief Administrative Officer for The Sustainability Consortium and was a founding Board of Directors member and President of the Illinois River Watershed Partnership.

When he's not promoting beneficial uses and conservation of water resources Mike can usually be found engaged in some form of water-based recreation such as boating, fishing or snow sports.

12:40 pm - 1:25 pm,"Whitewater Room and Zoom","GIS at the Crossroads: Building Data-Driven Freight Solutions for Pullman and Whitman County","Melissa Cleveland and Cody Hodgson (Welch Comer Engineering)",Invited presentation,"The Pullman-Whitman County Freight Alternatives Study, completed in 2025 for the Palouse Regional Transportation Planning Organization, used GIS analysis to identify practical freight corridors that could divert heavy truck traffic away from downtown Pullman, Washington. This presentation explores how GIS tools enabled data-driven collaboration among regional partners in both Washington and Idaho.Presenters will discuss the process of layering spatial data, travel modeling, and public feedback to rank alternative freight routes, as well as how GIS visualization strengthened community understanding and consensus. Attendees will gain insight into replicable techniques for multi-jurisdictional freight studies, integrating GIS analytics into route evaluation, and effectively communicating technical findings to non-technical audiences.
