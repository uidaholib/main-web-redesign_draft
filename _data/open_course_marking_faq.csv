Why are we doing Course Marking?,"Textbook costs might seem like a drop in the bucket of financial burdens
that many students face, but they are one expense where individual
instructors and faculty can make a difference. This difference shows not
just in course affordability, but in student academic success. Research
[shows](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-016-9434-9)
that students in courses which have Zero or Very Low Cost course
materials have higher test scores and lower DFW rates compared to
students using a traditional, high-cost textbook.

In addition to the positive impact on academic success, retention, and
persistence, course marking meets our institutional and statewide goals.
Course marking fulfills part of the mandate set forth by the Idaho State
Board of Education in their [2021 Instructional Material Access and
Affordability
policy](https://boardofed.idaho.gov/board-policies-rules/board-policies/higher-education-affairs-section-iii/iii-u-instructional-materials-access-and-affordability/)
and algins with the University of Idaho's [strategic
plan](https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/provost/StrategicPlan/2023-annual-report.pdf)."
Where did Course Marking come from?,"Nationally, marking affordable courses has been on the rise for a number
of years. Oregon was the first state to enact course marking legislation
in 2015 (Oregon House Bill 2871), followed by California (2016),
Washington (2017), Texas (2017), Colorado (2018), Virginia (2019), and
Louisiana (2019).

The Idaho State Board of Education enacted course marking legislation as
part of their governing policies and procedures in June 2021, under the
Instructional Material Access and Affordability policy. That policy can
be viewed at [III.U. â€“ Instructional Material Access and Affordability
06-2021](https://boardofed.idaho.gov/board-policies-rules/board-policies/higher-education-affairs-section-iii/iii-u-instructional-materials-access-and-affordability/)."

Who else is doing course marking?,"Institutions in seven states have implemented affordable course markings
as a result of legislation: Oregon, California, Washington, Texas,
Colorado, Virginia, and Louisiana. Beyond these institutions, systems
such as the University System of Georgia, the Connecticut State College
and University System, City University of New York, and State University
of New York have implemented course marking projects.

Within Idaho, our sister institutions are in the process of implementing
their own course marking systems. In developing the plan for UI, the
Course Marking Team consulted materials shared by the above
institutions, in addition to material from [Marking Open and Affordable
Courses: Best Practices and Case
Studies](https://uta.pressbooks.pub/markingopenandaffordablecourses/),
edited by Sarah Hare, Jessica Kirschner, and Michelle Reed."
"What does ""course materials"" mean?","Course materials are defined as primary required teaching and learning
content: textbooks and their equivalents, literary texts, digital
learning platforms, homework systems, etc.

""Recommended"" materials are not addressed by this project because they
are optional and students may acquire or not without negatively
impacting their ability to succeed in the course, according to their own
preferences and needs."
What does Zero Cost mean? What about Very Low Cost?,"**Zero cost** -- Students who take a zero cost course should expect to be
able to access all required materials for the course for zero cost
during the whole term. This can be achieved by courses using the
following types of materials:

-   Openly licensed textbooks
-   OER (open educational resources)
-   Freely available content such as materials in the public domain
-   Licensed materials may be used in cases where Library course
    reserves can provide resources that allow for an unlimited number of
    simultaneous users.
    - *Important Note: Not all current Library Digital Course Reserves will meet or be able to meet this standard due to materials having different simultaneous user policies.*

**Very low cost** -- the materials cost less than $30 at full MSRP.

-   This category is for courses that have a cost of less than $30 for
    the full, msrp, non-discounted price of a new textbook.
-   Inclusive Access materials in which the total preferred package cost is less than $30.
-   Used texts should **not** be used to qualify a text for this category. The full price of the text, purchased new at the Vandal Bookstore or comparable retailer, is the determining price.

Try out the [U of I Course Cost Labeling Tool](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/instruction/cost-labeling-tool/) for help determining if either of these designations apply to your course."
How do I calculate the cost of my course materials?,"Course material costs are calculated using the full price of the text,
purchased new at the VandalStore or another comparable textbook
retailer.

If you're happy with the course textbook you currently use, look up the
price online or [contact the VandalStore](https://vandalstore.com/home)
for assistance. If your course materials are less than \$30, your course will receive a Very Low
Cost course designation. If your course materials are \$0, your course
will receive a Zero Cost course designation.

If your course materials are higher than \$30, your course will not
receive any course cost designation at this time. If you want to find a
lower cost version of the text you use and are happy with, you have
options! [Contact the U of I Libraries](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/help/) and we'll be
happy to work with you to find a lower cost replacement using open
educational resources (OER), library-owned licenses, or another
high-quality solution."
Why don't used books count for course marking?,"Used book prices should **not** be used to qualify a course for a Zero
or Very Low Cost course designation. The full price of the textbook,
purchased new at the Vandal Bookstore or comparable retailer, is the
determining price.

The aim of Course Marking is to clearly identify courses that use Zero
Cost and Very Low Cost course resources without having to deploy the
range of strategies students often use to navigate course materials cost
complexity. Those options, including used and rentals often available at
a lower price, remain available to students, for both low cost and
unmarked courses. Used copies may not be available in sufficient
quantity to meet course enrollment, and used prices are subject to wide
variability, making it impossible to assure students enrolling in a
low-cost course that they can find a used copy at a compliant price.
Similarly, rentals are a part of the very complexity we\'re trying to
help students navigate. With Course Marking, we want to identify courses
that are affordable by design, rather than by skill at finding the
cheapest possible version."
I just post everything on Canvas so students can access it for free. Why don't my courses have a Zero Cost designation?,"In order for your courses to be marked as Zero Cost in the registration
system, you need to report ""no material required"" to your department's
course scheduler when you turn in your syllabus. Making sure Zero Cost
courses are effectively and accurately marked in the registration system
ensures that our students can make informed choices about their
financial burden. We'd also encourage you to reach out to the [librarian
in your discipline](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) to
ensure that the materials you're posting on Canvas are
copyright-compliant and accessible for students using screen-readers or
other adaptive technology solutions."
What is the technical process behind course marking? What do I need to do as an instructor?,"Each instructor will need to identify the course material costs for each
course they are teaching. This is as simple as looking up the new price
of the textbook online! Then, instructors will report each course's
course materials cost to their course schedulers. Instructors will work
directly with their department's course schedulers to report their
course costs as part of the registration process."
When is course marking being implemented?,"Course marking was initially deployed in Spring 2024 for Fall
2024 courses."
What can I do to lower my course materials cost?,"There are a variety of strategies for reducing costs of required course
materials. Publishers may be willing to directly negotiate a lower cost,
particularly if enrollment is high. VandalStore staff may be able to
identify lower cost versions of a book (such as unbound versions) or
source enough previous editions to meet enrollment. U of I Libraries
provides a number of resources to develop lower cost course materials,
including providing support in [identifying open educational resources
(OER)](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/open/oer_resources.html), identifying
library-licensed content suitable for meeting learning objectives, and
providing [hosted library course
reserves](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/). U of I Libraries
also [provides
funding](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/open/fellowship/call.html) for
instructors who choose to implement OER in their courses, with awards
for OER adoption to OER development, and provides an open publishing
platform, [Pressbooks](https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/), for instructors
interested in adapting or developing their own OER.

Many instructors have reduced and even eliminated costs for their course
materials. Of course, there are courses that require expensive materials
in order to meet learning objectives. Eliminating or reducing cost where
possible enables students to afford more costly content when it\'s
assigned. When costly materials are required, instructors are encouraged
to provide students with information about the lowest cost ways of
accessing that content, as many already do."
