Open Access Button,"When you encounter an article behind a paywall that the library doesn't subscribe to, the Open Access Button can quickly check for a freely available version. Furthermore, if the article is not found in their indexes, it will mediate the process of requesting an open copy from the author. In fact, most major publishers permit authors to [post a copy of the article in institutional repositories](https://blog.openaccessbutton.org/making-more-research-open-access-one-paper-at-a-time-25b95cd36c8f). Try it on the website or install the browser extension.",Access,https://openaccessbutton.org/
Unpaywall,"Unpaywall uses [DOIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) to match an article behind a paywall with a freely available version from an index of nearly 25 million free scholarly articles maintained by nonprofit [Our Research](https://ourresearch.org). Unpaywall crawls tens of thousands of hosting locations, including institutional and disciplinary repositories, academic journal websites, and more. Install the browser extension to check for open versions of any article.",Access,https://unpaywall.org/products/extension
CORE Discovery,"CORE Discovery browser extension searches OA resources to connect users to freely accessible versions of research behind paywalls. CORE is a research-driven global aggregator that harvests research outputs and offers the largest dataset of open metadata and full text in the world. Their free browser extension allows you to efficiently use the power of this data to discover open research.",Access,https://core.ac.uk/services/discovery/

Google Scholar Button,"The Google Scholar Button treats any webpage like an article and looks it up in Google Scholar. It provides shortcuts to some of Google Scholar's features, like citing articles or other versions, as well as the search engine itself. The particular value of the Google Scholar Button is that you can highlight some chunk of text on a webpage and with a click of the button, you can search for items with that phrasing. It's an efficient means to finding other articles on related topics reasonably quickly. And since it provides a proxy link for items that the U of I subscribes to, it works as an alternative tool for accessing subscribed content, not just open content.",Discover,https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn?hl=en
Lazy Scholar,"Lazy Scholar is focused on easing access to content using existing indices, regardless of their openness. It has settings to enable authentication through a proxy server to access material through U of I subscriptions. It collects citation information, scans articles for references and other content, and exports papers to reference manager software. It is maintained by researcher [Colby Vorland](https://twitter.com/nutsci).",Discover,http://www.lazyscholar.org/
