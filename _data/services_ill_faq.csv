ILL,Visiting Patron Accounts,"Patrons of Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries can request Summit Visiting accounts at any other member library.

**U of I Patrons**

Eligible U of I patrons can visit the circulation desk at any of the other Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries and ask to be adopted as a Summit Visiting Patron. You will need to present your U of I Vandal Card and be able to log in to your library account to verify eligibility. Some libraries also require a second form of photo ID such as a driver's license. 

**Non-U of I Patrons from other Alliance libraries**

To set up a Visiting Patron account at the U of I Library, bring your library ID to the circulation desk. Staff will ask you to verify your status with your institution by having you log in to your library account. A U of I Library account will then be created for you."
ILL,Illiad,"If Rapido is unable to find a partner library to fill your request, we will try expanding the search to even more libraries via ILLiad. You may be asked to register for an [ILLiad account](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll) to facilitate this expanded request."
ILL,Overdue Fines,"The University of Idaho Library relies heavily on reciprocal agreements with other libraries. Please return your materials in a timely manner so that we can maintain positive relationships with the libraries we borrow from. 

If you need to keep an item beyond its due date, you can request a renewal through your [library account](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/account?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID) or by contacting the [ILL department directly](libill@uidaho.edu).
