No previous experience is required for this introductory level workshop. </span><a role=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#doi"" class=""expand""><span class=""fas fa-plus-circle"" aria-hidden=""true""></span><span class=""sr-only"">expand</span></a>","<a href=""http://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/individual/n8856066"">Beth Hendrix</a>","<a href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/UIdaho_DOI_for_Data.pdf"" target=""_blank""><span class=""fas fa-file""></span>Slides</a><br>"
