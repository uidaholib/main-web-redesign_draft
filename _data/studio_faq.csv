You can book the room up to two weeks in advance using our reservation system LibCal on the Studio homepage. Same-day reservations may be possible but are not guaranteed. Please cancel your reservation if no longer needed to allow others to use the space.

You will receive a confirmation email after you have made a reservation. Then, bring your Vandal Card to the library at the time of your reservation. The staff at the Circulation Desk will check out the Studio key for you. Return the key by the end of your reserved session time."

We also have equipment available to record audio in the Studio. Already set up for easy use are two SM58 microphones, MPK Mini MIDI keyboard, and a Focusrite audio interface with 1/4"" input. These options should suffice for podcasts, single track recordings, simple MIDI input, and simple video voiceover. 

The Studio is currently optimized with light sound paneling to record podcasts, short films, and interviews. Other audio recording is possible, but do not expect the same outcome as a recording booth or soundproofed room. Certain musical instruments are allowed as long as volumes are kept at an appropriate level. No percussive instruments whatsoever."
