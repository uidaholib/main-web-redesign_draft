Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have ushered in a new era of geospatial AI (GeoAI) applications with the capacity to quickly and accurately extract valuable insights from extensive geospatial datasets, approximating human-like cognition. The synthesis of big data and GeoAI holds the potential to rapidly establish situational awareness, thereby enhancing operational efficiencies and responsiveness in disaster response efforts. In light of these advancements, this talk delves into the multifaceted challenges, innovative solutions, and practical applications that synthesize big sensor data and GeoAI to extract vital information for guiding decision-making in the context of natural disasters.",Special Topic,qunying_huang_geoai_gisday2023.pdf,,https://youtu.be/WzCC9PNijZs
2023,"Land Change Analysis Tool (LCAT)",Phil Roberts,"FPAC GEO, USDA","In 2018, FPAC Geo developed the Land Change Analysis Tool (LCAT) to create high resolution landcover maps utilizing Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology. The team employs several geospatial and spatial data analysis tools using GIS software, scalable computation platforms, and geospatial scripting. For each state, a sampling strategy is developed by consulting local experts. Training datasets are generated by leveraging “crowdsourcing” throughout the GEO organization, USDA, and academia with a web-application. Imagery is then classified using a machine learning algorithm that models landcover based on the training datasets. Resulting maps are published and available for download internally and to the public. Our internal partners have been the primary drivers for this product but development of a nationwide high resolution landcover dataset is streamlining and enabling other agencies to explore innovative conservation and land management projects that save time and money. Expanding partnerships with internal and external groups creates a pipeline for talent while discovering new uses and applications for this dataset.

Beaver habitats have been demonstrated to increase groundwater exchange, maintain surface water during drought or low flows, and promote thermal heterogeneity by increasing groundwater and surface water exchanges. As climate change will continue to impact riparian habitat and riverine ecosystems through changes in precipitation and temperature, the identification of restoration activities for managers that promote and facilitate cold-water refuges for imperiled salmonids is critical. Using Thermal Infrared Imagery (TIR), we are developing a methodology that maps and models the thermal profile of salmonid-bearing watersheds.
