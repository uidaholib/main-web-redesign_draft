Imagery is then classified using a machine learning algorithm that models landcover based on the training datasets. Resulting maps are published and available for download internally and to the public. Our internal partners have been the primary drivers for this product but development of a nationwide high resolution landcover dataset is streamlining and enabling other agencies to explore innovative conservation and land management projects that save time and money. Expanding partnerships with internal and external groups creates a pipeline for talent while discovering new uses and applications for this dataset.
