This workshop will go over the basics of metrics and altmetrics, discuss current trends and limitations of metrics, and explore various scholarly metrics tools. </span><a role=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#metrics"" class=""expand""><span class=""fas fa-plus-circle"" aria-hidden=""true""></span><span class=""sr-only"">expand</span></a>",Annie Gaines,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/Meaningful_metrics_workshop.pdf,,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/Meaningful_metrics_handout.pdf,,,
Introducing Jupyter Notebook for Python and R,2016-03-02,"<a href=""http://jupyter.org/"">Jupyter Notebook</a> is a powerful tool for writing, using, and sharing code, perfect for academic teaching and learning. <span id=""jupyter"" class=""collapse"">For researchers using Python and other languages, it is an efficient interface to iteratively explore data, present live code to students, or share data driven visualizations with colleagues. If you are just getting started with programming, it is also a great interactive environment for learning and prototyping code. This workshop will introduce the unique features that code notebooks offer to researchers and students. Participants will learn how to install and use Jupyter with the IPython and R kernels. Intended for: students, faculty, and staff interested in learning about code notebooks, sharing code, or learning to code. Complete beginners interested in learning about programming with Python are welcome and encouraged to attend! </span><a role=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#jupyter"" class=""expand""><span class=""fas fa-plus-circle"" aria-hidden=""true""></span><span class=""sr-only"">expand</span></a>",Evan Williamson,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/workshops/UIdaho_Jupyter_workshop.pdf,,,,,
