Additional support comes from liaison librarians as part of their conventional duties to their colleges."

What happens if an article has multiple authors?,"The fund will cover a maximum of $2000.00 per article. The article maximum is prorated per University of Idaho author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of UI authors. Each eligible UI author can receive up to the prorated portion of the APCs (subject to their individual author cap), while the prorated portion for non-UI authors is not eligible for funding."
Are University of Idaho authors now required to publish in certain types of journals?,"No, this fund was established to assist authors who want to publish in open access journals and does not impose requirements on non-applicants."
What types of fees are covered by the fund?,"Article processing charges (APCs), which are the costs associated with publishing open access journal articles, are covered by the fund. Open access membership fees, such as PeerJ Memberships, will be considered on a case-by-case basis if other eligibility requirements are met. "
What types of journals are eligible for the Fund?,"Journals must be listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and journal publishers must be members of, or comply with, the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA). All journals must utilize peer-review and make articles fully open upon publication. We use OASPA and DOAJ membership criteria to verify that publishers and journals adhere to responsible, sustainable, and non-exploitative publishing behavior."
"Does the UI-OAPF cover articles published in ""hybrid"" journals?","No, articles published in ""hybrid"" journals are ineligible for funding."
"Can the UI-OAPF be used to cover other open access publication types, such as conference presentations and books?","Not at this time. Other open access publication types, such as books, book chapters, and conference proceedings may be supported in the future."
"Do authors need to exhaust other funding sources that cover APCs, such as grants, before applying to the UI-OAPF?","Yes, we strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so. Priority will be given to applications without other sources of funding available."
What is the review process and who decides which applications receive funding?,"When applications are received, the UI-OAPF Fund Manager will use a standard rubric to evaluate applications against the eligibility criteria and approve or reject funding requests. The UI-OAPF Fund Manager will then share funding decisions and a copy of the rubric with applicants via email."
What is the procedure for payment or reimbursement?,"Upon funding approval, the author will forward the invoice directly to the Library's Administrative Financial Specialist and the UI-OAPF Fund Manager, or direct the journal to do so. The article processing charges will be paid directly to the journal publisher. The fund prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of the payment. The UI-OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers."
What is open access?,"Open access (OA) is the practice of providing free, unrestricted access to content via the Internet, most commonly to scholarly journal articles. OA removes price barriers between users and content and is compatible with peer review, copyright, preservation, and quality associated with conventional scholarly literature."
What is a hybrid journal?,A hybrid journal is a toll-access journal that makes certain articles freely available under open licenses.
Are open access journals peer reviewed?,"Yes, open access journals are compatible with peer review. The UI-OAPF only accepts applications for articles that are published in peer reviewed open access journals."
Are there other ways to make my research freely available to readers?,"Yes, as an author you often have the right to place a version of your article in an institutional repository (IR), such as the UI IR, or a disciplinary repository. However, your rights and the details about the specific article version are determined by your publication agreements with publishers."
