The University of Idaho Library is proud to announce our new [Digital Collections Search](https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/search)! This custom developed platform enables users to keyword search across more than 100 collections and 60,000 items. The interface provides researchers powerful tools, providing facets such as Subject, Location, or Date to filter results, while searching an index containing the full information about items and their full text content.

We invite you to explore our collections in a new way--find relevant historical research, browse fascinating items, and discover hidden treasures!
