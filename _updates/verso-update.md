date: 2025-08-26

As part of the university website redesign, faculty profiles in [VERSO](https://verso.uidaho.edu/esploro/), the Libraryâ€™s Research Information System, are now more prominent, with many departmental and college web pages linking directly to them. 

Faculty can edit and update their profiles at any time by logging in with their U of I credentials. If you encounter issues or would like support in making your profile accurate and current, the Library is available to help!

Find out more at our [VERSO documentation](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/verso/), email <lib-verso@uidaho.edu> with question, or use our [VERSO contact form](https://forms.office.com/r/Kef7ziHzHy).
