Previously located in the Janssen Engineering Building (JEB) Room 211, the Computer Science Assistance Center (CSAC) is a community computer science space open to all students taking computer science courses. It is staffed by CS majors who can help with coursework Monday-Friday during fall and spring semester.

Co-locating the CSAC and the Data Hub - which supports data science and programming across the U of I curriculum - will make it easier for students to receive comprehensive support with research and coursework.

For more information, and to view the CSAC tutoring schedule, visit [the CS Department Student Services](https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/cs/student-services) and [Data Hub](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/datahub/) pages.
