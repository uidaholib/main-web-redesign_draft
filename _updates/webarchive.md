title: Access Archived Website Content

With the recent launch of the University's new website, much of the previous site content has been removed or moved to the intranet. Anticipating this, the Library preserved past versions of the site through our Archive-It subscription, in partnership with the Internet Archive. This means you and your students can continue to access older university content and resources via the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).

Please visit our [How to Use Web Archives tutorial](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/webarchive/howto.html) to learn about accessing these resources and finding broken links.
