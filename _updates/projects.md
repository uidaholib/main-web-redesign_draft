The Library's Digital Collections Team is excited to share several new digital scholarship projects that make unique materials accessible on the web:

- The [Marylyn Cork Priest River Historical Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/priestriver/)  offers a digitized archive of photographs documenting the industries, organizations, and daily life of Priest River and surrounding Bonner County communities.
- The [Dr. Richard B. Wells collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/wells/) offers a glimpse into decades of analog academic inquiry, from college lab notebooks and index cards to the final manuscripts of an intellectual who worked largely without computers.
