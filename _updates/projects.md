The Library's Digital Collections Team is excited to share several new digital scholarship projects that make unique materials accessible on the web:

- The [Taylor Wilderness Research Station Archive](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/taylor-archive/) presents video interviews, archival documents, and artifacts that reveal the stories of those who have shaped this extraordinary place.
- The [Context Podcast Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/context/), a collaboration with the Idaho Humanities Council, provides engagement with Idaho's past, present, and future through the IHC's Context podcast series. Recorded throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the series offers unique insights into history, philosophy, politics, literature and more.
- The [Sheldon Z. and Vernice Thayer Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/thayer/) features  an Idaho family’s outdoor adventures in the Northwest during and after the Great Depression through digitized  photographs and correspondence from Sheldon Zadok Thayer’s personal collection.
