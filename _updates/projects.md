- [Raycide Mosher Civil War Letters](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/mosher/) present a collection of letters written by Union soldier Raycide Mosher to his Michigan family between 1864 and 1865.
- [Latah Legacy Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/) makes available the Latah County Historical Society's long running journal publication, the *Latah Legacy*. The issues feature articles, reviews, resources, and events that explore the post-colonization history of the region and document the organization's history.
