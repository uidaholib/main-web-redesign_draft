The Library's Digital Collections Team is excited to share several new digital scholarship projects that make unique materials accessible on the web:

- The [Hispanic Oral History Project Interviews](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/hohp/) highlights a series of interviews conducted in 1991 with Hispanic immigrants and their descendants living in Idaho. The collection has recently been updated using the U of I Library’s Oral History as Data platform, which allows researchers to navigate the recordings by themes, searching keywords, as well as the ability to toggle between English and Spanish transcriptions.
- The [Marylyn Cork Priest River Historical Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/priestriver/)  offers a digitized archive of photographs documenting the industries, organizations, and daily life of Priest River and surrounding Bonner County communities.
