The U of I Library has entered into a new [Publish and Read agreement](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/agreements/) with [MDPI Institutional Open Access Program](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/agreements/mdpi.html).
For any manuscript where at least one author is an U of I affiliated author, MDPI will grant a 10% reduction on the published APC (article processing charge) for the journal.
