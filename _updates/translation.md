University of Idaho professor Miranda Wilson has published her project, [Mechanics and Aesthetics of Cello Playing](https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/beckervioloncellospiels/), a new translation of Hugo Becker's influential 1929 cello book, as an open access edition through the Library.
Wilson's new translation addresses the challenging technical language used in this important text, which was the first to discuss the biomechanics of cello playing.
