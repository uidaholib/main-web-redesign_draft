__*And we need your help!*__

We are asking you to share your favorite photos from your time as a student at U of I. 
These images will be assembled into an ever-growing online photo album for Vandals everywhere to share and explore favorite memories. 
Though we're initially focusing on photos taken during the 1960s and 1970s, we are more than happy to accept photos from any decade.

## Contribute

Helping is easy!

<div class="border rounded p-3 m-3" markdown="1">

**Step 1:** Scan your photos at home or have your photos scanned at any one of many local retailers such as Costco, Walmart, or Walgreens. Please scan at high quality (minimum 300 dpi).[^1]

**Step 2:** Once you have your favorite photos scanned, upload them [using our online submission form](https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6g6KAE6dc7GxkuF){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}!

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-pride-gold" href="https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6g6KAE6dc7GxkuF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Submit Your Photos!</a>

That's it! 
We'll compile images as we get them into an easy-to-explore digital photo album that will continue to grow as we get new submissions.

The Vandal Family Photo Album will help the Library preserve the history of our institution by crowdsourcing a new collection of photos and memories that complements current collections such as the [Gem of the Mountains Digital Yearbook Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/), [The Argonaut Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/argonaut/), [Student Organizations Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/pg2/), and [University of Idaho: Then and Now](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/campushistory/).
