This tutorial will show you how to find books in the U of I Library.

## 1. Search for Books
{:.h3}

- Start on the Library home page: [lib.uidaho.edu](https://lib.uidaho.edu){:target="_blank"}. You can use the catalog’s search bar to search for books.

- You can search by a book’s title, if you know what book you are looking for. If you don’t have a specific book in mind, you can search by keywords using a general keyword or two.

- For example, when researching earworms, as in when you can’t get a song out of your head, you can use “earworms” as a keyword.

## 2. Limit Search Results

- To limit the search results, navigate to the **Refine My Results** section on the left of the screen and select options such as availability, resource type, creation date, etc. 

- When searching for books, you can limit the results by **Resource Type** by clicking **Show More**, checking the box for **Print Books** and **eBooks**, and clicking **Apply Filters**.

## 3. Find eBooks
{:.h3}

- To access an eBook copy of a book, click the **Online access** link located below the book's title, author, and date of publication. Then click the link under the **View Online, full text availability** heading. This link is the title of a collection of eBooks. After clicking the link, you can follow the onscreen prompts to view the book.

## 4. Request Books via Summit
{:.h3}

- If a source has **Check Access Options** under its title, it means that the Library doesn’t have a copy. But we can likely get one via our Summit library program that allows you to borrow print materials and media from regional academic libraries. 

- When you’re signed-in to your library account, you will see the option to place a Summit request.
