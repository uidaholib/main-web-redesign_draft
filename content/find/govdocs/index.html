    <h3>Federal Depository Library Program</h3>

    <p>The Federal Depository Library Program was initiated by Congress in 1813. Today the Government Printing Office oversees the program under the authority of Title 44 of the United States Code. The University of Idaho Library joined the program in 1907. In 1967, the U of I Library became a regional depository, meaning it acquires 100% of items issued by GPO through the FDLP Program. As a regional depository, the library also oversees eight other selective depositories in the state of Idaho.</p>
