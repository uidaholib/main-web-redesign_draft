		<h5>Step 1: Find a call number </h5>
<p>
Government documents at the University of Idaho Library may be located by using our library catalog. If you know the name of a particular document you'd like to see, just use the catalog to find a call number or ask for assistance at the reference desk.

Because the government documents collection at the library are in closed stacks, patrons wishing to obtain a document need to request it either in the Government Documents/Special Collections Reading Room during our open hours or at the Circulation Desk after hours.

		 <p>The Federal Depository Library Program was initiated by Congress in 1813. Today the Government Printing Office oversees the program under the authority of Title 44 of the United States Code. The University of Idaho Library joined the program in 1907. In 1967, the UI Library became a regional depository, meaning it acquires 100% of items issued by GPO through the FDLP Program. As a regional depository, the library also oversees eight other selective depositories in the state of Idaho.</p>
