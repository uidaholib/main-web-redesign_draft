## 2. Search for Articles
{:.h3}

- You can search by an article’s title, if you know what article you are looking for. If you don’t have a specific article in mind, you can search by keywords using a general keyword or two.

- For example, when researching earworms, as in when you can’t get a song out of your head, you can use “earworms” as a keyword.

- Type keywords **earworms music brain** in the search box. This is the same as using the Boolean phrase **earworms AND music AND brain** because the database automatically puts an AND in all capital letters between each word. 

- Click the magnifying glass after typing the keywords.

## 3. Find Full-Text Articles
{:.h3}

- Click the HTML, PDF or linked full text icon on the left to view the whole article.

- A “check for full text availability” means the library may or may not have access to the full text online. 

- If the full-text is not available, it can be ordered for free from [Interlibrary Loan](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/). Once you are signed in to your library account, you can click "Request from Interlibrary Loan" to submit your request.
