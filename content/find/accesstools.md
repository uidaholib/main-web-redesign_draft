Did you know that many academic articles behind a paywall have a free [open access](https://sparcopen.org/open-access/) version available?
Did you know that you can connect external tools to your library account for seamless access to our subscriptions?
 
This curated list of tools goes beyond our [library catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID) to help you access resources using both U of I library subscriptions *and* open access repositories so that you can get articles in the fastest and simplest way possible. 
If we donâ€™t have access, please put in a request with [Interlibrary Loan]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}). 
As always, don't hesitate to contact a [reference librarian]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) with any questions!

Tools for article access and discovery on the web:
{% for t in site.data.find_access-tools %}
- <a href="#{{ t.title | slugify }}">{{ t.title }}</a> ({{ t.type }}){% endfor %}

---------------

{% for t in site.data.find_access-tools %}
<a id="{{ t.title | slugify }}"></a>
{% capture text %}
{{ t.description }}

{% if t.link %}<a href="{{ t.link }}" class="btn btn-success">{{ t.title }}</a>{% endif %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include feature/card.html header=t.title text=text %}

{% endfor %}
