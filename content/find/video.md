## Video Platforms

Similar to other library licensed content, streaming videos can only be accessed on campus or by logging in with your U of I account.
Platforms include:

Using our mediated purchasing model, patrons will need to submit a request to the library in order to access new Kanopy videos. Requests can be submitted via the Kanopy website. When planning to use a Kanopy video during the semester, please check the expiration dates listed in the Library catalog record to ensure uninterrupted access.
