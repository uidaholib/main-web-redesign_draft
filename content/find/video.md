The library subscribes to several streaming video platforms for the classroom and personal use of our patrons.
The library also holds an extensive <a href="#dvds">collection of DVDs</a> available for lending.

## Video Platforms

Similar to other library licensed content, streaming videos can only be accessed on campus or by logging in with your U of I account.
Platforms include:

- <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://video.alexanderstreet.com/channel/academic-video-online" >Academic Video Online (AVON)</a> - featuring more than 70,000 titles Academic Video Online includes a wide variety of material and subject areas with curricular relevance: documentaries, interviews, feature films, performances, news programs and newsreels, demonstrations, and raw footage. 
- <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.kanopy.com/" >Kanopy</a> - the library purchases one year licenses to films on demand from the Kanopy catalog. Using our mediated purchasing model, patrons will need to submit a request to the library in order to access new Kanopy videos. Requests can be submitted via the Kanopy website. When planning to use a Kanopy video during the semester, please check the expiration dates listed in the Library catalog record to ensure uninterrupted access.
- <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/unividaho295672/#/digitalCampus/browse" >Swank Digital Campus</a> - Swank offers streaming of feature films and documentaries produced by major Hollywood and independent studios. A small selection of titles are licensed on request.
- <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/?email=^u" >O'Reilly's Learning Platform for Higher Education (Safari)</a> - In addition to ebooks, Safari has a wide selection of videos and online courses for learning about tech topics. First-time users must enter a U of I email address to set up an account with Safari, after which they can log into the platform directly.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, please <a href="{{ '/help/' | relative_url }}">contact a librarian</a>.
For requests to view a streaming video from another provider or licensing questions, please email <lib-erm@uidaho.edu>.
