## Cash

Cash gifts are always encouraged and the simplest way to make a gift to the University of Idaho Library. They can be directed to any area of your choice, and can be for outright expenditures, or added to an <a href="endowments.html">existing endowment</a>.

## Planned Giving

There are many different ways to make a planned gift to the University of Idaho Library. These include bequests,
charitable trusts, gift annuities, pooled income funds, and life insurance. They also offer unique tax advantages.
Many donors find planned gifts are an ideal way to support a cause that is important to them, while meeting their
income needs and/or providing for family members. For more information about planned gifts, contact
<a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/give" >University of Idaho Giving</a>.

## In-kind Gifts (Materials and Personal Collections)

Gifts to the library have helped build stature in scholarship, research and teaching. For materials, we are able
to accept only those which enhance our collections. Upon receipt, the library owns gifts and reserves the right
to determine their retention or disposal. For information about how you can make a gift of materials that will
support our academic and research mission, please call <a href="tel:+1-208-885-2503">(208) 885-2503</a> or email Rami Attebury
(<a href="mailto:rattebur@uidaho.edu">rattebur@uidaho.edu</a>). In general, we do not accept:

- Journals and other regularly-published periodicals
- Newspapers
- Non-regional newsletters
- Items in poor condition
- Textbooks
- Outdated audiovisual materials
- Books and other items that do not support the library's mission and collection development policies

## Tax Benefits

Charitable gifts generate tax deductions - both federal and state. While you need to consult your own tax
adviser as to how a gift impacts your tax obligation, we do have knowledgeable professionals and resources available
to help explain the general tax benefits of a particular type of gift.

## Appreciated Assets

Holdings, such as corporate securities and real estate, that have appreciated in value make great giving assets.
The University of Idaho credits you for the full fair-market value of the stock or land, and there are some favorable
tax benefits.

## Memorial or Honorary Gifts

To make a gift in memory or in honor of someone, attach a note with your gift that includes the name of the person
you are memorializing or honoring. For memorial gifts, also include the family contact name(s) and address(es).
For honorary gifts, include the address of the person you are honoring. We will send a card to the family/individual
to notify them that you have made a gift. (The amount of your gift will not be revealed.)

If a special memorial fund or honorary fund has already been created in the person's name, your gift will be credited
to that account unless you tell us otherwise. If a special fund has not been created, your gift will be credited
to the designation you indicate.

        <h2>Who was W. C. Cheney?</h2>
            <p>W. C. Cheney, circa 1898-circa 1977, earned his living as a machine shop operator. "With drill and lathe and
              torch," writes Rafe Gibbs in his history of the University of Idaho, Beacon for Mountain and Plain, "Cheney
              was a master." He also was an inventor who applied his imagination and skill to many avocations, including
              astronomy, history, and photography. </p>

            <p>Cheney's place of birth has not been identified, but according to the finding aid for the William Cheney Motion
              Picture Collection at the Oregon Historical Society, Cheney was a child in Oregon City, Oregon when he became
              interested in photography. As a youth, he discovered astronomy and mountain climbing. </p>
            <p>In 1922, Cheney lived in Tillamook. By 1927 he had taken a wife, whose name is not known, and was living in
              Oceanside. The couple lived briefly in Portland before moving to Longview, Washington around 1930. Sometime
              in 1933, Mr. and Mrs. Cheney moved to Seattle where he still lived when he donated his Americana collection
              to the University of Idaho in 1961. The specific date and place of his death also are unknown.</p>
        <h2>History of the W. C. Cheney Americana Collection 1900-1960</h2>
            <p>In March 1961, W. C. Cheney wrote to University of Idaho President D.R. Theophilus offering a significant -
              and unusual - gift.  University of Idaho Reports, June 1962
              <a  href="{{ site.lib-media }}/about/timecapsule/UI_Reports.pdf">announces</a> the gift. </p>
            <p>In his sixties when he wrote to President Theophilus, W. C. Cheney had operated a machine shop in Seattle,
              Washington for most of his life. A machinist by vocation who specialized in manufacturing custom-built torches,
              Cheney's avocations were astronomy and history. As an amateur astronomer, he built his own observatory and
              the equipment within it. Cheney's interest in history led him to collect a large volume of textual materials
              and material objects that he felt were "an authentic cross section of events" that occurred during his life.</p>

              The textual materials Mr. Cheney gathered were the common information sources of the first half of the 20th
              century, such as newspapers and magazines. He also collected catalogs; posters; concert programs; calendars;
              playbills; restaurant menus; advertisements; and correspondence of all sorts, including business letters,
              love notes, and even "junk mail." In addition to the paper items, Mr. Cheney collected material objects,
              such as milk bottles, toys, and tokens. </p>

            <p>Cheney also preserved historically significant radio programs and announcements. "On wax (and even on glass
              during World War II) he recorded history as it was being made - the landing of Charles Lindbergh in Paris
              in 1927;the stock market crash of 1929;the "blood, sweat and tears" speech of Winston Churchill in World
              War II;the bombing of Pearl Harbor," writes Rafe Gibbs in

            <p>Beginning in 1960, Cheney began placing the materials he had collected in unique storage containers: 
              55-gallon steel drums formerly used to hold oil. Eventually there were 17 barrels.
            </p>
            <p>The University of Idaho was first on Mr. Cheney's list of schools to which he would offer his collection, and
              at their April 1961 meeting, the University's Board of Regents accepted his gift. According to Rafe Gibbs
              in
              <em>Beacon for Mountain and Plain</em>, Mr. Cheney had selected the University of Idaho, "which he knew only
              by reputation," because of the institution's "concern for America's heritage" and its "desire to build upon
              it." </p>
            <p>In accepting the gift, the Regents willingly agreed to the two stipulations Mr. Cheney specified in his March
              16, 1961, letter to President Theophilus: that the drums "be stored in a clean dry place, and, NOT OPENED
              'TILL 2010." After their receipt, the barrels were stored in the basement of the University of Idaho Library
              where they remained undisturbed until February 2010 when Library staff began processing the collection. </p>
