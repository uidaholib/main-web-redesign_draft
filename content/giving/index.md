## Contribute to the largest library in Idaho!

Since 1892, the University of Idaho Library has grown from a single classroom located in the University Administration Building to become the largest library in the state of Idaho, providing access to millions of resources and materials for U of I students, faculty, and alumni, as well as Idaho citizens.

We now house well over a million books and almost ten thousand print and online periodical subscriptions. Additionally, we continue, as we have for over a century now, to serve as an official regional depository of U.S. federal government publications, making <a href="https://libguides.uidaho.edu/Documents">almost two million government documents</a> available to the public.

## Bringing Idaho to the World

Not satisfied with only bringing the world to Idaho, we also bring Idaho to the world. Our <a href="{{ '/special-collections/' | relative_url }}">Special Collections and Archives</a> provide researchers access to unique historical photographs, archival maps and documents, rare books, and the <a href="http://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/">International Jazz Collections</a>, the premier jazz archives of the Pacific Northwest.

Our [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) makes many of these and other unique resources freely available worldwide online via [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) like the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/">Gem of the Mountains Digital Yearbook Collection</a> and the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/postcards/">Northwest Historical Postcards Collection</a>.
