Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to speak with [Leesa Love](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/llove.html), U of I - OAPF Fund Manager, or their [library liaison]({{ '/about/liaisons.html' | relative_url }}) to determine whether their application meets the eligibility criteria.

U of I affiliated authors may apply for funding multiple times until their author cap is met or funds are exhausted. 
Applications are accepted on a first come, first served basis during each funding period, until funds are exhausted or the end of the funding period.

{% capture article_criteria %}
#### Articles

- Must be accepted for publication before submitting an OAPF application
- Official invoices and receipts must have issue dates and payment dates within the current funding period (i.e. funding period #1 July 1 - December 31, funding period #2 January 1 - June 16).
- Funding per article is capped at $2000.00

#### Journals

- Must be listed in the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ)
- Must utilize peer-review
- Must make articles fully open upon publication

#### Journal Publishers

- Must be members of, or comply with, the <a href="https://oaspa.org/membership/members/">Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association</a> (OASPA)

We use DOAJ and OASPA membership criteria to verify that publishers and journals adhere to responsible, sustainable, and non-exploitative publishing behavior.

Please note that "hybrid journals," journals that charge subscription fees to readers but offer authors the *option* to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their article open access, are ineligible for funding from the U of I - OAPF.

Open access membership fees, such as PeerJ Memberships, will be considered on a case-by-case basis if other eligibility requirements are met.

#### Authors

- Current U of I faculty, staff, researchers, and enrolled students, as well as emeritus faculty, are eligible to apply for the OAPF
- Funding per author is capped at $3000.00 per fiscal year
- Authors may apply for funding multiple times until their cap is met or funds are exhausted

Applicants must be current U of I affiliates throughout the application, award, and payment/reimbursement process. Cases in which an applicant leaves or graduates from the U of I during the award or payment/reimbursement process will be referred to the Dean of Libraries for review and final decision.
      
#### Multi-Authored Works

Multi-authored works with more than one U of I author will be prorated by dividing the total requested article processing charges (APCs), up to the $2,000.00 per article maximum, by the number of eligible U of I authors. Each eligible U of I author can receive up to the prorated portion of the APC (subject to their individual author cap); non U of I authors are not included in this calculation.

For example, if an article with an APC of $2,000.00 had four eligible U of I authors and one non-U of I author, the APC ($2,000.00) would be divided by the number of eligible U of I authors (4), resulting in each U of I author receiving $500.00 of funding towards their per fiscal year author cap and the entire APC being paid or reimbursed by the U of I - OAPF, pending funding availability.

#### External Funding

Priority will be given to OAPF applications without other sources of funding available.
      
We strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so. 
Authors with sufficient funding from grants or contracts are encouraged to use those funds to allow others to share in the benefit of open publications.

{% capture documentation %}
U of I - OAPF funding is contingent upon providing proper documentation to the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/llove.html">U of I - OAPF Fund Manager</a> and the Library’s Fiscal Officer. 
Invoices or receipts with issue dates or payment dates that have been changed (including, but not limited to: reissued invoices, credit notes, etc.) do not meet the U of I – OAPF’s documentation requirements.
