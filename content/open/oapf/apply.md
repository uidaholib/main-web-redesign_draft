U of I - OAPF funding is contingent upon providing proper documentation to the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/llove.html">U of I - OAPF Fund Manager</a> and the Library's Fiscal Officer. 
Documentation differs based on the preferred method of payment, as detailed below:
      
- Option 1: U of I - OAPF pays the invoice
- Option 2: U of I - OAPF reimburses applicant for invoice payment

Invoices or receipts with issue dates or payment dates that have been changed (including, but not limited to: reissued invoices, credit notes, etc.) may not meet the U of I - OAPF's documentation requirements.
