The University of Idaho Library’s **Think Open Fellowship** is an opportunity to equalize access to educational materials in your classroom and save your students money by supporting the use of low- or no-cost course materials in place of traditional textbooks.

The Think Open Fellowship Grants are intended to:

1.  Lower the cost of college for students and contribute to their retention, progression, and graduation.
2.  Pilot different approaches in University of Idaho courses for textbook transformation including adopting and adapting existing resources, creating Open Educational Resources (OER), and identifying materials already available from the UI Library.
3.  Provide support to faculty to implement these approaches.

This fellowship awards up to $1,250 to selected faculty, and fellows would be expected to:

*   Commit to using an open textbook or affordable alternative (total cost less than $50) for a course in fall 2019 (faculty teaching high enrollment courses, dual-enrollment courses, and Idaho Gem courses are especially encouraged to apply)
*   Participate in educational workshops to build skills and competency around open educational resources and affordable alternatives
*   Work cooperatively and collaboratively with peers
*   Fellows who complete the program will have the opportunity to serve as mentors for the following year’s fellows

*Faculty teaching high enrollment courses, dual-enrollment courses, and Idaho Gem courses are especially encouraged to apply.
