The Idaho State Board of Education established a Pressbooks platform for Idaho universities to increase open publishing as one means of improving access and affordability in higher education. The University of Idaho Library supports our institutional instance of Pressbooks to create quality OER publications, websites, and books.

Pressbooks is web-based book production software used by authors and educational institutions around the world to create textbooks, monographs, syllabi, white papers, and more. The platform is designed to make creating or adapting existing content easier, with an online editing interface similar to using WordPress CMS that can output multiple formats including:

- Website
- EPUB ebooks
- Print PDF

Openly licensed textbooks and OER are powerful tools for education, allowing users to build upon each otherâ€™s work. With Pressbooks you can adapt an existing textbook to tailor for your specific course, add interactive content, or create new resources.

To get started using [Pressbooks at U of I](https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/) to publish your work or adapt an existing OER, please contact Open Publishing Librarian [Leesa Love]({{ '/about/people/llove.html' | relative_url }}).
