“The goal of the Accessibility Toolkit is to provide the resources needed so that each content creator, instructional designer, educational technologist, librarian, administrator, teaching assistant, etc. has the opportunity to create a truly open and accessible textbook. An open textbook that is free and accessible for all students.”

[BC Open Textbook Authoring Guide](https://opentextbc.ca/opentextbook/) (BCcampus)

“This book is a practical guide to adapting or creating open textbooks using the PressBooks platform. It is continually evolving as new information, practices and processes are developed. The primary audience for this book are faculty in British Columbia, Canada who are participating in the B.C. Open Textbook project. However, there may be content within this book that is useful to others working on similar Open Educational Resource initiatives.”

[OER Research Toolkit ](http://openedgroup.org/toolkit)

The OER Research Toolkit is comprised of the OER Research Guidebook and several additional resources assembled by the Open Education Group, an interdisciplinary [research papers](https://essay-lib.com/research-paper/) group that (1) conducts original, rigorous, empirical research on the impact of OER adoption on a range of educational outcomes and (2) designs and shares methodological and conceptual frameworks for studying the impact of OER adoption.
