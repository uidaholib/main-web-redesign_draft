**Privacy**  
Verso is designed to show professional and research data. However, you may hide specific content from public view. 
* In *Output*: Click asset ellipsis -> *Hide this work*  
* In *About* or *Affiliations* -> Use eyeball icon and set to *Not Visible* (eyeball will be crossed out)

* If you would like your profile to be hidden entirely, please contact <u><a href="mailto:lib-verso@uidaho.edu">lib-verso@uidaho.edu</a></u>  
* Hiding data does not delete it. It will not be visible to the public when they use Verso, but your data will remain in our system for use in analyzing the total ouput of the U of I. If you would like your research and profile data to be completely removed from Verso, a request must be submitted in writing to <u><a href="mailto:lib-verso@uidaho.edu">lib-verso@uidaho.edu</a></u>
