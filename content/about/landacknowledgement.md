U of I Moscow is located on the homelands of the Nimiipuu (Nez Perce), Palus (Palouse) and Schitsu’umsh (Coeur d’Alene) tribes. 
We extend gratitude to the indigenous people that call this place home, since time immemorial. 
U of I recognizes that it is our academic responsibility to build relationships with the indigenous people to ensure integrity of tribal voices.
