The 2016 ACRL [Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education](https://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework) provides an overarching framework for the Library’s Teaching, Learning, and Research activities (as defined above as a Work Cluster). This document defines information literacy as "the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning." The full document offers a great deal of additional context and detail. Additional literacies defined by the Library align with the larger goal of developing information literacy in our students, and our larger campus community.

To clarify and amplify the distinct educational value that the Library provides to our students, the Library faculty has defined distinct learning literacies. These literacies clearly articulate our instructional goals, support scaffolding of course-integrated instruction, and strategically inform the development of credit-bearing Library courses, workshops, presentations, and asynchronous learning content. This framework is rooted in established scholarship and uniquely responsive to the specific needs of our student community, and aims to enhance our instructional coherence and effectively communicate the vital role librarians play in fostering academic excellence.
