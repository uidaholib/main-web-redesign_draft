## Mission

As Idaho's flagship research library, the University of Idaho Library connects our users with information, ideas, tools, and spaces; enriches formal and informal learning opportunities; supports and advances research, scholarly, and creative activity; builds partnerships through regional and national outreach; and preserves university, state, and regional historical archives.

## Vision

The University of Idaho Library will develop and expand our capacity and skills to provide our users with the resources, training, and expertise of a world-class research library. We champion the transformative power of ideas and learning, inspire our students to engage in a lifelong pursuit of intellectual development, and provide an essential foundation for innovation, research, and scholarship.

## Values

As a part of the University of Idaho, we share the values of Excellence, Respect, Integrity, Perseverance, and Sustainability. As a library we embrace the values of Community, Access and Stewardship, and Intellectual Freedom. These values are interwoven into a learning culture that helps fulfill the educational, outreach, and research missions of both the University and the Library.

- **Community:** Through individual efforts, innovation, teamwork, and collaboration, we endeavor to provide user-centered services to all stakeholders locally, regionally, and nationwide.
- **Access and Stewardship:** We provide open, equitable, and efficient access to a diverse and interdisciplinary spectrum of information resources and physical spaces for both current and future users.
- **Intellectual Freedom:** We oppose censorship and provide individuals with the tools to explore and engage with multiple points of view.
