The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the Library can provide accurate, thorough, and timely estimates of library-related costs associated with proposed new degree programs. These estimates support institutional planning, accreditation requirements, and informed decision-making during the program approval process.

## Scope

This policy applies to all university faculty and academic units proposing new degree programs, certificates, concentrations, or substantive curricular changes that may require additional library resources.

## Policy Statement

Faculty proposing new academic programs should engage the University Library early in the proposal process and provide sufficient lead time and documentation to allow subject librarians and library staff to assess existing resources, identify gaps, and obtain cost estimates for any new or expanded library materials, services, or infrastructure required to support the program.

A minimum of **four (4) weeks** is typically required for the Library to complete a library cost assessment once all required information has been received.

### Faculty Responsibilities

To receive an accurate library cost estimate, faculty proposers are responsible for the following:

1.  **Advance Notification**  
    Faculty should notify the Library of their intent to propose a new degree program at least four (4) weeks prior to the internal deadline for program proposal submission.

2.  **Requested Documentation**  
    Faculty are asked to provide the following information when available:
    - Program title and degree level (e.g., bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral)
    - Anticipated program start date
    - Proposed curriculum, including course titles and brief descriptions
    - Expected enrollment numbers (initial and projected)
    - Instructional modality (e.g., in-person, online, hybrid)
    - Accreditation or professional standards, if applicable
    - Any known or preferred information resources (databases, journals, datasets, media, etc.)

3.  **Timely Communication**  
    Faculty should respond promptly to requests for clarification or additional information from subject librarians or other library staff during the review period.

### Library Responsibilities

Upon receipt of complete documentation, the University Library will:

1.  **Assign Subject Librarians**  
    Appropriate subject librarian(s) will be assigned to review the proposal based on disciplinary relevance.

2.  **Assess Existing Resources**  
    Subject librarians will evaluate current library collections and services to determine the extent to which existing resources support the proposed program.

3.  **Identify Resource Gaps**  
    The Library will identify additional resources required to meet instructional, research, and accreditation needs.

4.  **Obtain Vendor Quotes**  
    When new or expanded resources are needed, library staff will contact vendors to request pricing and licensing information. Vendor response times may vary and are a key reason for the four-week minimum review period.

5.  **Provide a Cost Estimate**  
    The Library will prepare a written cost estimate summarizing one-time and ongoing costs, assumptions used, and any limitations or uncertainties.

### Timeline Requirements

- The four-week review period begins **only after** the Library has received the requested information.
- Requests submitted with less than four weeks’ notice may result in:
  - Delayed estimates
  - Preliminary or incomplete cost information
  - Exclusion of library cost data from the program proposal

#### Rationale for Timeline

- The Library has individual liaison librarians with expertise in specific disciplines. Each new proposal will be evaluated by the appropriate librarian, and this timeline ensures the correct librarian will have time to investigate resources, consult with colleagues as needed, and work with technical services staff to obtain price quotes.
- The Library has technical services staff who evaluate library products with an eye to technical compatibility with library systems, the university’s authentication system, and legal licensing requirements.
- Many library product vendors often require initial meetings with library staff to understand the scope of new programs, the university’s size, and the library’s budget capabilities before they are willing to provide an initial price quote. Once a quote is provided, negotiations involving price and licensing agreements may take several weeks.

### Limitations

Library cost estimates are based on available information at the time of review and vendor pricing at the time quotes are received. Costs may change due to vendor pricing updates, licensing terms, currency fluctuations, or changes in program scope.
