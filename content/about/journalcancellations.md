Throughout the year, the Library reviews its journal and database subscriptions to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the campus community and that we are maximizing the impact of our subscriptions budget.

For example, in 2024 the Library reached a 5-year agreement with [Elsevier](https://www-sciencedirect-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/) to bring back access to more than 2300 academic journals at significantly reduced cost from our earlier "big deal" package. 
With this agreement, the Library also secured open access provisions that [give U of I authors a discount to make their work open access](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/agreements/elsevier.html).
Additionally, beginning in 2023 the Library brought back the full catalog of over 1300 journals from [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us).
In order to fund these packages, the Library had to cancel approximately 100 journals from other providers.

Any journals that are cancelled will remain available via [Interlibrary Loan]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}). 
If we have cancelled something that you would like us to keep or if you have suggestions for new titles, suggestions for journals will be rated highly in future discussions as funding becomes available. 

Please fill out the form below with any requests or suggestions that you have.
