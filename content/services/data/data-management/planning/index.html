                <h3>Why Manage Your Data?</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Meet grant requirements:</strong> Many funding agencies now require that researchers deposit in an archive any data which they collect as part of a research project in a repository. </p>
            	</li>
                <li><p><strong>Increase the visibility and impact of your research:</strong> Making your data available to other researchers through widely-searched repositories may increase your prominence and demonstrate continued use of the data and relevance of your research</p>
            	</li>
                <li><p><strong>Preserve your data:</strong> Depositing your data in a repository guarantees their availability to you and other researchers. Doing so safeguards your investments of time and resources and preserves your unique contribution to research.</p>
            	</li>
                <li><p><strong>Facilitate new discoveries:</strong> Enabling other researchers to use your data reinforces open scientific inquiry and may lead to new and unanticipated discoveries. Doing so also prevents duplication of effort by enabling others to use your data rather than trying to gather the data themselves.</p>
            	</li>
                <li><p><strong>Increase your research efficiency:</strong>Documenting your data throughout their life cycles increases efficiency by ensuring you and others will be able to understand and use your data in the future.  It will also ensure the integrity and proper description of your data are maintained.</p>
            	</li>
                <li><p><strong>Simplify your life:</strong> Enabling a repository to house and disseminate your data allows you to focus on your research rather than responding to requests or worrying about data that may be housed on your web site.</p>
            	</li>

                <li><p><strong>Support open access:</strong> Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of the need to manage their work and consider issues of scholarly communication. </p>
            	</li>
                </ul>

				<h3>Data Management Guidelines by Funding Agency</h3>
				<p>Many funding agencies require that research data produced as part of a funded project be made publicly available and formal data management plans are now required. Some of the major funding agencies with data sharing policies include:</p>
                 
                <div id="agencyList" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>National Science Foundation</h4>
                <p>
                <a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/research/fundingagencies/proposal/nsfdatamanagementplan">NSF Data Management Plans</a> - from the University of Idaho Office of Research </p>
                <p><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">National Science Foundation: Dissemination and Sharing of Research Results</a> Data Management Plans are now required for all new NSF proposals. NSF expects PIs to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work."  </p>                
                 
                <h4>National Institutes of Health</h4>
                <p><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/">NIH Data Sharing Policy</a></p>
                <p>For most grants over $500,000, a data sharing plan must be included in the application and incorporated as a condition of the award. Final research data "should be made as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of participants, and protecting confidential and proprietary data".</p>
                 
                <h4>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</h4>
                <p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/maso/Policy/ReleasingData.pdf">CDC Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data</a></p>
                <p>"The purpose of CDCs data release/sharing policy is to ensure that (1) CDC routinely provides data to its partners for appropriate public health purposes and (2) all data are released and/or shared as soon as feasible without compromising privacy concerns, federal and state confidentiality concerns, proprietary interests, national security interests, or law enforcement activities."</p>
                 
                <h4>United States Department of Education</h4>
                <p><a href="http://ies.ed.gov/funding/datasharing_policy.asp">Institute of Education Sciences (IES) Data Sharing Policy</a></p>
                <p>"The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) expressed its commitment to advancing education research through the sharing of scientific data collected through its grant-funded research programs. The purpose of this <a href="http://ies.ed.gov/funding/datasharing_implementation.asp">data sharing implementation guide</a> is to describe how this policy will be implemented and to provide guidance to grant applicants."</p>
                </div>
                  
                <p>Researchers can comply with these data sharing requirements by depositing their data into one of the many available <a href="../storing/depositing.html">data repositories</a>.</p>
