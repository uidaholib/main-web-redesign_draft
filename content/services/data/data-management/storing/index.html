	  			                  <h3>File Formats</h3>
                  <p>The format you use to represent your data is one of the main factors for determining how likely someone else will be able to use your data in the future. </p>
                  <p>Eventually, much of the hardware and software we use today will likely become obsolete, so it's important to make the effort now to <em>use formats that are most likely to remain accessible</em> in the future. It's also important to use formats that save as much of the original information as possible. </p>
                  <p><strong>Guidelines for choosing appropriate file formats: </strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Choose formats that are non-proprietary. 
                    	<blockquote>Example: Instead of saving your spreadsheet as an Excel file (.xls), save it as a Comma Separated Values file (.csv).</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use formats that do not compress your data.
                    	<blockquote>Example: For images, use a TIFF format rather than a GIF or JPEG format that automatically compresses (and therefore deletes!) information in your file.</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use formats that are in common usage by the research community. 
                    	<blockquote>Example: HTML and CSV files are formats that have been widely adopted for use and are readable by a wide variety of software.</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use formats that are unencrypted. Data security, we know, is important, but an encrypted dataset whose key has been lost (say the password is forgotten) is no dataset at all. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Preferred formats:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Image: JPEG, JPG-2000, PNG, TIFF</li>
                    <li>Text: HTML, XML, PDF/A, UTF-8, ASCII</li>
                    <li>Audio: AIFF, WAVE</li>
                    <li>Containers: TAR, GZIP, ZIP</li>
                    <li>Databases: prefer XML or CSV to native binary formats</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>File and Folder Naming</h3>
                  <p>There are many guidelines out there regarding the best ways to name your files. These guidelines help one organize their files, prevent accidental deletion, and help others in the future better understand the file's contents from its filename. </p>
                  <ul><p><strong>General Guidelines</strong></p>
                    <li>Decide on a naming and organizational convention among you and your collaborators.</li>
                    <li>Be consistent using it for files, folders, and directory structures. It will help others sharing your files and others accessing your files in the future to better intuit the nature and organization of your files. </li>
                    <li>Use names that describe the contents of the file or folder: Include relevant location, date, and version information in the filename.
                      
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none"><strong>For locations</strong>: Use abbreviations for frequently used sites and include a plain text file in the file's folder that explains any abbreviations used in the naming. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none"><strong>For dates</strong>: Use the format recommended by the International Standards Organization (ISO 8601): YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none"><strong>For versioning</strong>: Include a version number at the end of the file name (such as "v01"). Change the number each time you save, and substitute the word "FINAL" for the final version number.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use names for files and folders that include a Unique Identifier (i.e. Project name or Grant #). </li>
                    <li>At the same time, try to keep names under 32 characters or less. </li>
                    <li>Avoid using the following characters in your names: "/ \ : * ? " &lt; &gt; [ ] &amp; $. These characters have specific meanings in your computer's operating system that could result in misreading or deleting these files</li>
                    <li>When using sequential numbering, make sure to use leading zeros to allow for multi-digit versions. For example, a sequence of 1-10 should be numbered 01-10; a sequence of 1-100 should be numbered 001-100 (e.g. the 11th item would be numbered 011).</li>
                    <li> Use only one period and have it appear before the file extension (e.g. name_paper.doc  
                      NOT name <strong>.</strong> paper <strong>.</strong> doc OR name_paper <strong>..</strong> doc) </li>
                    <li>Use underscores (_) rather than spaces to separate terms.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h3>Storing and Backing Up Your Data (Short Term Archiving)</h3>
                <p>In order to to properly safeguard your data files, you should both <b>STORE</b> your data in a secure location that you can readily access and <b>BACKUP</b> your data in a separate physical location from those files in storage. </p>
                <p>Here is what we mean by Storage and Backup:  
                   
                  <b>Storage</b> refers to preserving your data files in a secure location you can access readily. 
                   
                  <b>Backup</b> refers to preserving additional copies of your data in a separate physical location from data files in storage. </p>
                <p>Storage systems often provide mirroring, in which data is written   simultaneously to two drives. This is not the same thing as backup since   alterations in the primary files will be mirrored in the second copy.</p>
                <p>Backup preserves older copies so you can restore your data if   accidental deletion/alteration or a disaster such as fire, flood, or   hardware malfunction damages your data in storage.</p>
                <p>When it comes to safeguarding your important data assets, remember both storage and backup are essential!</p>
                 
                <h4>Storing Your Data </h4>
                <p> Your data should be stored somewhere that is accessible and secure at the very least. Using a service like <a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://mozy.com/">Mozy</a>, <a href="http://www.carbonite.com">Carbonite</a>, or <a href="http://www.adrive.com/">ADrive</a> will help you store and maintain the integrity of your data files across different computers and locations. </p>
                <p>Many of these services provide mirroring services that will link a folder on your computer's hard drive with a folder stored on an online server. This means that when you save or make changes to files stored on your hard drive, those files are added or revised to in their online storage locations as well. </p>
                 
                <h4>Backing up Your Data</h4>
                <p>Following a good storage routine is one way to ensure your data is backed-up to some extent. However, to mitigate any losses of data, one should backup their data on a regular basis to another server or external hard drive that resides in a different physical location than your stored data.</p>
                <p>A simple way to do this is to backup your data on a regular basis to an external hard drive that you store at your home rather than at your office. You can also upload your data to another cloud storage service (such as those mentioned above) on an ongoing basis. </p>
                <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Having too many backups can be as detrimental to the authenticity and preservation of your files as having none at all.  Once you establish a protocol, follow it, and when you backup your data, make sure you do not create multiple copies of the same files or versions of files in different locations.  Backup to one location, and keep that location ordered and updated. </p>
                 
                <h4>Storing and Backing Up Your Lab's Data</h4>
                <p>Labs present a special problem for the storage and backup of data, as the large amount of data and the varying number of people who have access to that data can threaten the preservation of that data.  Establishing protocols for both the storage and backup of that data can help avoid problems in this regard.  Particularly, using a mirroring service, like those mentioned above, or a shared server, can help members of the lab to avoid losing any data. </p>

                  <h3>Depositing Your Data in a Repository (Long Term Archiving)</h3>
                  <p>There are many reasons to share your data with the world at large. Not least among these reasons is that several publishers and national funding agencies require you to do so. Sharing your data also, and more altruistically, allows your data to be used to answer other questions, both now and in the future. Most importantly, sharing data makes your papers more likely to be cited by other scientists: <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308">One study</a> found a 69% increase in citations for articles whose associated data were available online.</p>
