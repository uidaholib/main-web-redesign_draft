Leganto is the U of I Library's integrated course reserves platform that helps make course materials more accessible to students.
Embedded directly into your Canvas course and connected to the library's resources, Leganto allows instructors to easily create and customize reading lists, so that students can access all their course materials in one place.

Information for instructors can be found at the [ExLibris Leganto Guide](https://exlibris.libguides.com/c.php?g=1004425&p=9997893) or contact [libreserve@uidaho.edu](mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu) for personalized help.

## How to Activate Leganto in Canvas

To get started using Leganto the library will need to activate your Canvas course--please follow the instructions below.
Once activated, you will be ready to [add, edit, save, and customize reading lists in Canvas]({{ site.lib-media }}/reserves/leganto_reading_list.pdf).

### 1. Let the library know your Course ID number

- From within your Canvas course, navigate to "Settings" and the "Course Details" tab. Your course ID number is in the SIS ID field.

- Copy and paste the Course ID (in the example above, "202100_123LIB") and email it to <libreserve@uidaho.edu>. In your email, please include your course information, including the course title and number (e.g. "HIST 3000, Digital History"), as well as the Course ID.

### 2. Add the "Library Resource List" link to your Canvas content

In Canvas a resource list can be added as a [stand-alone Module](#{{ 'A. Add as stand-alone module' | slugify }}) or can be [added to an existing Module](#{{ 'B. Add to an existing module' | slugify }}). 

#### A. Add as stand-alone module

- Navigate to the "Modules"
