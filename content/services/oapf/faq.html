        <div class="panel-body">The fund will cover a maximum of $2000.00 per article. The article maximum is prorated per University of Idaho author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of UI authors. Each eligible UI author can receive up to the prorated portion of the APCs (subject to their individual author cap), while the prorated portion for non-UI authors is not eligible for funding. For example, if an article had two eligible UI authors and one non-UI author, the proration would be $2000 / 2 UI authors = up to $1000 per UI author.</div>

However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of the payment. The UI-OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers.</div>
