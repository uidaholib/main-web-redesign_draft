<p>Library faculty teach class sessions on how to search efficiently and effectively for information -- using library resources as well as the Web and other electronic resources. We provide general orientation to library research in freshman composition classes, but we also tailor class sessions for specific assignments in other courses.</p>
<p>We ask that classes requesting library instruction sessions have a current assignment that requires using library resources and that the students are aware of that assignment at the time of the session. Please plan to attend with your class; your presence is important.</p>
<p>To request a librarian led session, please click the button link to the our survey form, or use the survey embedded below.</p>
