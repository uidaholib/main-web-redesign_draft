<p>Interlibrary Loan (ILL) is a resource sharing service that allows U of I patrons to request materials that are neither owned by the U of I Library, nor available through <a href="summit.html">Summit</a>. ILL is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid U of I account.</p>

<p>Turnaround time for loan requests is typically <strong>7-14 days</strong>, while articles are usually received within <strong>1-2 days</strong>. Patrons are notified by email once their item arrives. Some items are more readily available than others, so, by necessity, we can't guarantee the receipt or delivery time of any requested item.</p>

<p>Interlibrary Loan's <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ILLiad platform</a> makes use of a Single Sign-On system to better serve our users. This allows patrons to access all library services using their U of I NetID credentials--the same log in used for access to BBLearn, VandalWeb, email, and other University of Idaho services.</p>
<p>The first time you login using the new SSO, you will be required to fill in information for a new account profile. If you had an existing account, your past request history will be merged into your new account. Once logged in, users can submit new requests and check the status of current items. Feel free to direct questions or concerns to <a href="mailto:libill@uidaho.edu">libill@uidaho.edu</a> or call (208) 885-6843.</p>

				<p>Before you can start requesting materials through Interlibrary Loan, you must register for an <a href="https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ILLiad account</a>. The first time you visit ILLiad you will log in with your U of I NetID credentials and be prompted to fill in your personal details to create an account profile. You will continue to use your university-wide login to access your ILLiad account after registration. Registration serves three main purposes: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>It simplifies the requesting process so that you don't have to re-enter your personal information every time you submit an ILL request.</li>
					<li>It allows us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately once your requested item arrives at the library. </li>
					<li>It lets you monitor the status of current requests, request renewals of ILL materials online, and view a complete archive of all your previous requests.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you do not know your university-wide log-in credentials, please contact the Interlibrary Loan office at (208) 885-6843, or by email at <a href="mailto:libill@uidaho.edu">libill@uidaho.edu</a>.edu, and we will help you set up your account.</p>

				<h4>Placing Holds on U of I Materials</h4>
				<p>Please do not use ILL to request materials that are owned by the U of I Library or held by one of our branch
					libraries (U of I Law Library, Idaho State Law Library, IMTC, Women's Center, and Herbarium). You can request
					these materials directly through the U of I Library's <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu/">online catalog</a>.</p>
				<p>First locate the item you want, then log in to your library account and place a hold on the item. The
					circulation desk will contact you once it is ready for checkout.</p>
				<h4>Information to Include in Your Request</h4>
				<p>Provide as much citation information as possible when submitting your requests. Include the author, title,
					and publication date for books; or the journal title, author, article title, volume, date, and page numbers
					for article requests. Accurate citation information helps us identify the item quickly and locate libraries
					that may be able to supply it.</p>
				<p>If you are having trouble locating the item you need, please contact the <a href="{{ '/help/' | relative_url }}"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reference Desk</a> for assistance.</p>

				<p>ILL requests are generally processed within one working day. Most books arrive within <strong>7-14 days</strong>,
					although items coming from other states or countries can take anywhere from <strong>2-8 weeks</strong>, so please plan
					accordingly. Articles are sent electronically and usually arrive within <strong>1-2 days</strong>.</p>
				<p>If you need to expedite a request, please include any special deadline information in the Notes field on
					the request form. You can also contact the ILL office directly at (208) 885-6843, or by email at <a href="mailto:libill@uidaho.edu">libill@uidaho.edu</a>.
				</p>
				<p>Generally speaking, if the item is located geographically nearby and is owned by a large number of
					libraries, it will arrive relatively quickly. Certain items can take longer, though, depending on their
					format and local availability status. Some examples include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rare, valuable or otherwise unique materials that would be difficult or impossible to replace</li>
					<li>Bulky or fragile materials that are difficult or expensive to ship</li>
					<li>Materials in high demand at the lending library</li>
					<li>Materials with local circulation restrictions, such as Reference or Course Reserve materials</li>
					<li>Audiovidual materials</li>
					<li>Musical recordings</li>
					<li>Computer software</li>
					<li>Reference materials</li>
					<li>Bound journals</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Sorry, we don't order <strong>required textbooks</strong> through Interlibrary Loan. Please try requesting these

				<p>Patrons will be notified by email once their ILL item arrives. Items for on-campus patrons can be checked

				<p>Off-campus patrons will also receive an email notification once their item has been received. We will
					deliver these materials to you by mail. Please contact the ILL office if the item does not arrive within a

				<h4>Articles</h4>
				<p>When your article arrives you will receive an email with instructions on how to access it. Articles are
					posted to your ILLiad account and can be retrieved under the "Electronically Received Articles" queue.</p>
				<p>Articles remain accessible for <strong>30 days</strong> after you receive the email notification and then are

				<h4>Renewals, recalls, and due dates are at the discretion of the lending library</h4>
				<p>Most ILL items can be renewed. However, if the lending library does not allow renewals, we will include a
					"No Renewal" note on the bookstrap. </p>
				<p>Renewal requests can be submitted directly through your ILLiad account. Select the "Checked Out Items"
					queue from the main menu, open the correct request, and click on the "Renew Item" button. If the lending
					library approves the renewal, we will update your due date accordingly. If they deny the request, we will
					send you an email and provide you with additional request options.</p>
				<p>Because renewal due dates are based on the date that the request is actually submitted to the lending
					library, and are not just an extension of the original due date, the option to request a renewal only
					becomes available 10 days prior to the due date. You will not be able to submit a renewal request before
					that period in order to ensure you have as much time as possible with the material.</p>
				<p>All Interlibrary Loan materials are subject to being recalled by the lending library. We will notify you
