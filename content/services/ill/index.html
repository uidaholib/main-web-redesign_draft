										<p>Before you can start requesting materials through Interlibrary Loan, you must first register for an ILLiad account. Registration serves three main purposes: </p>
											<ul><li>It simplifies the requesting process so that you don't have to re-enter your personal information every time you submit an ILL request.</li>
											<li>It allows us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately once your requested item arrives at the library. </li>
											<li>It lets you monitor the status of current requests, request renewals of ILL materials online, and view a complete archive of all your previous requests.</li></ul>
											<p>During registration you will be asked to enter a username and password. This is what you will use to log in to your ILLiad account. You can choose any password you like, but the username needs to match the 14-digit barcode from the back of your Vandal Card (starting with 20206...). </p>
											<p>If you do not have a Vandal Card, please contact the Interlibrary Loan office at 208-885-6843, or by email at <a href="mailto:libill@uidaho.edu">libill@uidaho.edu</a>, and we will help you set up your account.</p>

											<p>ILL relies heavily on email to let patrons know when their requested materials have arrived. Please keep your email address up-to-date and check it regularly.

											<h4>Placing Holds on UI Materials</h4>
											<p>Please do not use ILL to request materials that are owned by the UI Library or held by one of our branch libraries (UI Law Library, Idaho State Law Library, IMTC, Women's Center, and Herbarium). You can request these materials directly through the UI Library's <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu/">online catalog</a>.</p>
											<p>First locate the item you want, then log in to your library account and place a hold on the item. The circulation desk will contact you once it is ready for checkout.</p>
											<h4>Information to Include in Your Request</h4>
											<p>Provide as much citation information as possible when submitting your requests. Include the author, title, and publication date for books; or the journal title, author, article title, volume, date, and page numbers for article requests. Accurate citation information helps us identify the item quickly and locate libraries that may be able to supply it.</p>
											<p>If you are having trouble locating the item you need, please contact the <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/help/">Reference Desk</a> for assistance.</p>

											<p>ILL requests are generally processed within one working day. Most books arrive within <b>7-14 days</b>, although items coming from other states or countries can take anywhere from <b>2-8 weeks</b>, so please plan accordingly. Articles are sent electronically and usually arrive within <b>1-2 days</b>.</p>
											<p>If you need to expedite a request, please include any special deadline information in the Notes field on the request form. You can also contact the ILL office directly at 208-885-6843, or by email at <a href="mailto:libill@uidaho.edu">libill@uidaho.edu</a>. </p>
											<p>Generally speaking, if the item is located geographically nearby and is owned by a large number of libraries, it will arrive relatively quickly. Certain items can take longer, though, depending on their format and local availability status. Some examples include:</p>
											<ul><li>Rare, valuable or otherwise unique materials that would be difficult or impossible to replace</li>
											<li>Bulky or fragile materials that are difficult or expensive to ship</li>
											<li>Materials in high demand at the lending library</li>
											<li>Materials with local circulation restrictions, such as Reference or Course Reserve materials</li>
											<li>Audiovidual materials</li>
											<li>Musical recordings</li>
											<li>Computer software</li>
											<li>Reference materials</li>
											<li>Bound journals</li></ul>
											<p>Sorry, we don't order <b>required textbooks</b> through Interlibrary Loan. Please try requesting these materials through <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/summit.html">Summit</a> instead, or check to see if they are available on <a href="/services/reserve/">Course Reserve</a>. </p>

											<h4>Books</h4>
											<p>Patrons will be notified by email once their ILL item arrives. Items for on-campus patrons can be checked out at the circulation desk, unless it is restricted to "in library use only," in which case you will need to use the item on-site.</p>
											<p>Off-campus patrons will also receive an email notification once their item has been received. We will deliver these materials to you by mail. Please contact the ILL office  if the item does not arrive within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
											<h4>Articles</h4>
											<p>When your article arrives you will receive an email with instructions on how to access it. Articles are posted to your ILLiad account and can be retrieved under the "Electronically Received Articles" queue.</p>
											<p>Articles remain accessible for <b>30 days</b> after you receive the email notification and then are automatically deleted. You can also remove articles earlier by using the Delete button.</p>

											<h4>Renewals, recalls, and due dates are at the discretion of the lending library</h4>
											<p>Most ILL items can be renewed. However, if the lending library does not allow renewals, we will include a "No Renewal" note on the bookstrap. </p>
											<p>Renewal requests can be submitted directly through your ILLiad account. Select the "Checked Out Items" queue from the main menu, open the correct request, and click on the "Renew Item" button. If the lending library approves the renewal, we will update your due date accordingly. If they deny the request, we will send you an email and provide you with additional request options.</p>
											<p>Because renewal due dates are based on the date that the request is actually submitted to the lending library, and are not just an extension of the original due date, the option to request a renewal only becomes available 10 days prior to the due date. You will not be able to submit a renewal request before that period in order to ensure you have as much time as possible with the material.</p>
											<p>All Interlibrary Loan materials are subject to being recalled by the lending library. We will notify you by email if your due date suddenly changes.</p>

											<p>ILL relies heavily on reciprocal agreements with other libraries. Please return your materials in a timely manner so that we can maintain positive relationships with the libraries we borrow from. </p>
											<p>If you need to keep an item beyond its due date, you can request a renewal through your ILLiad account or by contacting the ILL department directly. If renewals are not allowed, we will be happy to request another copy of the item for you from a different library.</p>
											<p>ILL materials accrue overdue and lost book charges <b>for all patrons</b> at the following rates:</p>
