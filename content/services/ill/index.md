The University of Idaho Library uses Rapido for resource sharing services. This allows U of I patrons to request materials that are not owned by the U of I Library. Resource sharing is free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid U of I account. 

Turnaround time for physical loan requests is typically 5-14 days, while electronic articles or book chapters are usually received within 1-2 days. Patrons are notified by email once their item arrives (physical items) or is available for download (electronic items). Some items are more readily available than others, so we can't guarantee the receipt or delivery time of any requested item. 

## Requesting Items 

Items not owned by the U of I Library can be requested via the library’s catalog once you have signed in. You can monitor the status of requests in your library account. 

## Lending Periods 

Items loaned by partner libraries in the Orbis Cascade Alliance (formerly Summit requests) are typically available for 84 days, with one renewal allowed. If items are not available in other Alliance libraries, we will try to find additional partner libraries to fill the request. Loan periods for other libraries can vary. 

## Returning Materials 

Materials should be returned to the same location where you checked them out. The item needs to be returned on or before the due date, with the bookstrap or label still attached. 

Off-campus patrons can return Summit materials to the U of I Library through the mail. However you may want to use a form of delivery that provides tracking, since you are responsible for the item until the library actually receives it. 

Please use the following address for returning materials: 

```
University of Idaho Library
Circulation Desk 
875 Perimeter Drive MS 2350 
Moscow, ID 83844-2350 
```

## Visiting Patron Accounts

Patrons of Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries can request Summit Visiting accounts at any other member library.

**U of I Patrons**

Eligible U of I patrons can visit the circulation desk at any of the other Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries and ask to be adopted as a Summit Visiting Patron. You will need to present your U of I Vandal Card and be able to log in to your library account to verify eligibility. Some libraries also require a second form of photo ID such as a driver's license. 

**Non-U of I Patrons from other Alliance libraries**

To set up a Visiting Patron account at the U of I Library, bring your library ID to the circulation desk. Staff will ask you to verify your status with your institution by having you log in to your library account. A U of I Library account will then be created for you. 

## Illiad 

If Rapido is unable to find a partner library to fill your request, we will try expanding the search to even more libraries via ILLiad. You may be asked to register for an [ILLiad account](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll) to facilitate this expanded request. 

## Document Delivery 

Document Delivery provides electronic access to journal articles and book chapters from the U of I Library’s print collection. This service is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid U of I account. 

Please check the U of I Library’s online catalog for access to electronic journals and e-book collections prior to submitting a Document Delivery request. We may already have electronic access to the materials you need. 

Document Delivery requests can be submitted through the catalog via a Digitization link. You will receive an automated email notice once the item has been scanned and posted to your ILLiad account. Delivery time is approximately 24-48 hours. 

Document Delivery files remain accessible for 30 days after you receive the email notification and then are automatically deleted. You can also remove articles earlier by using the Delete button.
