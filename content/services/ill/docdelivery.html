				<p>Document Delivery provides electronic access to journal articles and book chapters from the UI Library's print collection. This service is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid UI account. </p>
				
				<p>Please check the UI Library's <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu/">online catalog</a> for access to electronic journals and e-book collections prior to submitting a Document Delivery request. We may already have electronic access to the materials you need.</p>
				
				<p>Document Delivery requests can be submitted through your <a href="http://illiad.lib.uidaho.edu/illiad/logon.html">ILLiad account</a>, just as you would any other article or book chapter request. You will receive an automated email notice once the item has been scanned and posted to your ILLiad account. Delivery time is approximately 24-48 hours. </p>
				
				<p>Document Delivery files remain accessible for <b>30 days</b> after you receive the email notification and then are automatically deleted. You can also remove articles earlier by using the Delete button.</p>
