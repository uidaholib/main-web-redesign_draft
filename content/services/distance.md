## Research Guides 

Trying to make sense of library resources can be confusing. 
To help, we've created hundreds of [research guides](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/?b=s) that are tailored to U of I classes and subjects.

Our [Distance Education guide](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/Distance_Education) provides detailed information about how to find and access resources.

## Online Resources 

The library has tons of materials you can access online. 
Check our [library catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID) for e-books, articles, and more, or [browse our databases](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/az/databases?) for scholarly and scientific articles.

To use the library off-campus, you'll need to log in to our catalog or databases with your U of I Net ID account, the same credentials you use to access email and Canvas/BBLearn. 

Stuck? [Ask us for help]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}) or see if your question is answered in the [Off-Campus Access guide](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/Distance_Education).

## Interlibrary Loan, Document Delivery, and Digitization Requests

Our [Interlibrary Loan (ILL) office]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}) can help you get electronic access to materials the library doesn't own or digitize physical materials from our print collections. 

- ILL service can provide electronic copies of materials held by other libraries across the world. To get started you will need to [create a profile in our ILLiad system](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll) used to make requests.
- [Document delivery service]({{ '/services/ill/docdelivery.html' | relative_url }}) provides electronic access to journal articles and book chapters from the U of I Library's print collection. Like ILL, requests are made through our [ILLiad system](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://uidaho.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll).
- [Digitization requests]({{ '/services/ill/docdelivery.html#digitization-requests' | relative_url }}) can be made from the [library's catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID) by clicking on "Digitization Request" from a print item's record.

Don't hesitate to contact <libill@uidaho.edu> with any questions!

## Curbside Delivery

Patrons can request locally-owned physical items from the U of I Library and pick them up curbside.

To request an item, navigate to the [library's online catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID) and search for a title. 
Then use the "request" link to place your "Curbside Pick Up". 
You'll receive an email when your item is ready, with a link to reserve a pick up time slot during open hours, Monday to Friday. 

Please note that it may take two or more business days from the time you place your request to receive your items! 
Contact us at <libcirc@uidaho.edu> with questions.

## Special Collections and Archives

Many of the unique materials held by Special Collections and Archives are discoverable via our [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). 
The rest of our holdings can be searched via [Archives West finding aids](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/search.php?r=idu).
