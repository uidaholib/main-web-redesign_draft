## Research Guides 

Trying to make sense of library resources can be confusing. 
To help, we've created [research guides](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/?b=s) that are tailored to U of I classes and subjects.

Our [Distance Education guide](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/Distance_Education) provides detailed information about how to find and access resources.

## Online Resources 

The library has tons of materials you can access online. 
Check our [library catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID) for e-books, articles, and more, or [browse our databases](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/az/databases?) for scholarly and scientific articles.

To use the library off-campus, you'll need to log in to our catalog or databases with your U of I Net ID account, the same credentials you use to access email and Canvas. 

Stuck? [Ask us for help]({{ '/help/' | relative_url }}).

## Interlibrary Loan/Rapido Resource Sharing

[Interlibrary Loan/Rapido Resource Sharing]({{ '/services/ill/' | relative_url }}) can help help you get electronic access to materials the library doesn't own or request chapters and articles from the physical materials available in our collections. Resource sharing is free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid U of I account. 

Don't hesitate to contact <libill@uidaho.edu> with any questions!

## Requesting and Returning Print Books

Off-campus students, staff, and faculty can request to have print books mailed to their home address. To request a print book, log in to our catalog with your U of I Net ID account, find the book you're interested in, then click 'Get It'. Select 'Home Delivery' as your 'Pickup Location', then click 'Send'. It may take 2-3 weeks for the book to arrive.

You should receive a mailing label along with books you receive from the library. Use the label to mail the book back to us when you are finished with it. If you don't have a mailing label, please return books to the following address: 

University of Idaho Library Circulation  
875 Perimeter Dr MS 2350  
Moscow ID  83844-2350
