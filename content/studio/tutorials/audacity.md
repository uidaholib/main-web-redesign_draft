In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of using the open-source software [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and audio interface Scarlett 18i20 in the Studio to record and edit audio.

## 1. Preparation
{:.h3}

Turn on the audio interface **Scarlett 18i20** (if it's not already on). If pressing the power switch does not turn it on, first power on the **Furman M-8X** located below the **Scarlett 18i20**.

Turn the gain knob for **Input 1** all the way to the right.

Ensure that both the recording device and playback device are set to Scarlett 18i20 USB.

To test your microphone, begin speaking at a comfortable level. Pay attention to the **Recording Meter Toolbar** (press the microphone icon to activate the recording level meter). The bars remain green until the signal reaches -12 dB then merge to yellow as the signal approaches -6 dB, which is a good maximum signal level to aim for.

To fade in and fade out, such as intro and outro music tracks, and make micro-adjustments to the audio files, use the **Envelope** tool.
