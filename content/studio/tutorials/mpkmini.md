The Akai MPK mini is a compact MIDI keyboard and pad controller used to play software instruments, trigger drum sounds, and control functions inside your recording software (DAW). It does not produce audio on its own; rather, it sends MIDI signals to your computer, which are then turned into sound by your DAW.

This quick reference highlights the most common controls you’ll use during studio sessions. It focuses on basic setup and performance features so you can start making music right away. For advanced customization, such as reassigning pads, programming the arpeggiator, or changing knob functions, use the free MPK mini Editor software from Akai.
