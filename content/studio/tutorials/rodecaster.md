In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of using RØDECaster Pro II to record a podcast or voiceover.

## 1. Getting Started: Power & Setup
{:.h3}
<ol start="1">
 <li>Press the red Power button <img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/studio/rode_power.png" alt="Red Power button on RØDECaster Pro II" width="5%"> located on the rear panel of the RØDECaster Pro II to turn on RØDECaster Pro II.
Push faders up to the thick white line—this is called unity gain (0 dB gain or no change to the input signal's level).

 <li>Put on the headphones and speak at your natural recording volume and distance from the mic. Watch the level meter on the touchscreen go up and down (Note that the level meter on the touchscreen does not include the minus signs):
 {% include feature/gallery-figure.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/studio/level_meter.png" alt="Level meter" caption="level meter" width="8%"%}
  <ul>
   <li>Aim for peaks between –6 (dBFS) and –3 (dBFS)</li>
   <li>Average around –12 (dBFS) to –15 (dBFS)</li>
  </ul>
Adjust your fader up or down if needed to stay within this range. (Make note of the labels of mics and headphones that are color-coded: pink and green on channel 1 and 2)

Use the knob to adjust the headphones volume to a comfortable level.

 </li>
</ol>
## 4. Exporting Audio
<ol start="1">
 <li>Eject the Flash Drive
 <ul>
 <li>Your recording is saved on a USB flash drive labeled “Studio” (with USB-C and USB-A connector).</li>
 <li>On the touchscreen, tap the home icon on the top right corner to return to the default home screen, then tap the flash drive icon <img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/studio/flash_drive_icon.png" alt="Flash drive icon on the touchscreen" width="5%"> on the top middle of the screen, then tap Eject.</li>
</ul>

 <li>Transfer Files to a Computer
  <ul>
   <li>Unplug the drive and use the USB-A (or USB-C) connector to plug the drive into a laptop.</li>
   <li>If you are using the Studio iMac computer, plug the flash drive into a blue port on the Anker Data Hub.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
{% include feature/gallery-figure.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/studio/blue_port.png" alt="Blue ports on the Anker Data Hub" caption="Blue ports on the Anker Data Hub" width="35%" %}
 </li>
 <li>Locate Your Files
  <ul>
   <li>Navigate to the RODECaster folder on the drive. The folder with the highest number is the newest recording session.</li>
   <li>You’ll find:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Stereo Mix.wav – a stereo mix of the entire session</li>
     <li>Track1-Mic 1.wav, Track2-Mic 2.wav, etc. – individual mic tracks</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Tip: Use the individual tracks for more flexibility in post-production.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Wrap Up</li>
Once you've transferred or uploaded your files (e.g., to OneDrive), eject and unplug the flash drive from the computer and reinsert it into the RØDECaster Pro II. Turn off RØDECaster Pro II by pressing the red Power button.
</ol>
## Quick Tips & Troubleshooting
{:.h3}

- Low levels? Recheck the mic connection and slowly raise the fader from the unity gain line. Be sure to also check out [Tips on Microphone Technique]({{ '/studio/mictechnique.html' | relative_url }}).
- Flash drive not detected? Unplug and reconnect or try a different port.
- Returning later? Save a copy of your work elsewhere. Files saved on the flash drive will be deleted periodically.
