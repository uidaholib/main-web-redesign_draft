When using the Mac mini in the WhisperRoom, ensure that the default audio input and output are set to the Scarlett 16i16. To check this: 
1. Open *System Preferences* → *Sound*. 
2. Confirm that both *Input* and *Output* are set to *Scarlett 16i16*. 

This setting also needs to be verified within any audio editing or playback software (e.g., Reaper, FL Studio) to ensure proper recording and playback.
