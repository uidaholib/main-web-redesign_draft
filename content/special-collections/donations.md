## Donations

Any potential donation of historical materials should be discussed with the department's staff in advance of the gift. External (non-University) donors are required to complete a Deed of Gift form. Having accurate and thorough documentation of donations is beneficial for our repository as well as for researchers. This form can be completed online or downloaded and filled out as a PDF.

### Faculty Papers Donation Guidelines

- [Faculty Papers Donation Guidelines PDF]({{ site.lib-media }}/spec/Faculty Paper Guidelines.pdf).

Special Collections and Archives collects faculty papers to preserve the institutional history of our university. It is important to document how decisions were made, how policies evolved, and how the university functioned as an organization over time. Our primary focus is on materials that document your role in the university's governance, administration, and institutional life. We are most interested in materials that show how you contributed to shaping the university as an institution: your service on committees, leadership of programs or departments, involvement in policy development, and engagement in matters that affected the university community. These materials help future researchers understand how the University of Idaho operated, evolved, and responded to challenges over time. 

We are also interested in discipline-specific scholarly materials when they align with the U of I's research strengths and regional collecting areas, such as environmental studies, natural resources, agriculture, and other fields central to the university's mission and the state's history. Scholarly, literary, and artistic work of national or international recognition or acclaim, produced during a faculty member's time at U of I, is also appropriate for our collection. Additionally, as a major historical repository for the state of Idaho, we collect materials about Idaho's history, culture, environment, and communities, regardless of academic discipline. Scholarly materials outside these areas are typically better preserved through disciplinary archives, research libraries, or professional organizations in your field. 

The guidelines below will help you identify which materials from your career best align with the collecting interests of the university archive. We ask all prospective donors to schedule a consultation with an archivist in advance of transferring any materials. This helps both parties identify the most appropriate materials for acquisition by the archives. 

Please contact us with questions or when you are ready to schedule a consultation with a Library archivist.

</div>

##### General Guidance: 

Focus on materials that document your contributions to the university as an institution and your role in shaping its policies, programs, and community rather than routine activities. Consider what would help future researchers understand how the university functioned, made decisions, and evolved during your time here. When in doubt about correspondence, prioritize letters that involve substantive discussions about institutional matters, policy development, or significant university issues. For research materials related to the University of Idaho's strengths or to Idaho itself, include enough documentation that someone could understand your methods and approach. Materials that document the process, context, and unique observational record of research are valuable, while materials that duplicate the published scholarly record are not. Similarly, materials offering unique documentation of Idaho, like original observations, data, perspectives, or records not available elsewhere, are most valuable for our role as a state historical repository.

{:#monetary}
## Monetary Support

Monetary support is not required when gifting archival materials. Financial contributions do enable timely processing and helps underwrite the costs of long-term high security storage. Such funds are used to organize, maintain, and care for our collections so that they may be preserved and made available for future generations.

Gift funds may be used to honor an individual, a family, a company, or an organization, and the Library will work with donors to employ appropriate means to publicly acknowledge donations. 
If interested in making a monetary gift to Special Collections and Archives, please contact Dulce Kersting-Lark, department Head, at <dulce@uidaho.edu> or call (208) 885-1309. To discuss setting up endowments or bequests, please contact Ben Hunter, Dean of University of Idaho Libraries, at <bhunter@uidaho.edu> or call (208) 885-5858.
