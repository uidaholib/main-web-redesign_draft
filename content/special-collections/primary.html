  these materials support research into nearly all facets of the history

<p>Access to the manuscripts and archival material in the library is primarily
  provided by the <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?menuitem=0&fromTop=true&fromPreferences=false&fromEshelf=false&vid=UID">online catalog</a>. Descriptive entries identify the persons,
  places, and things of prominence in the collection. Larger bodies of material
  frequently have supplementary inventories and descriptive guides, whose
  presence is also noted in the catalog. Kept in stack areas closed to public access, and frequently
  measured in the hundreds of cubic feet, these primary source materials
  are delivered to the reading room by knowledgeable staff upon request.
</p>

<p>Students, faculty, visiting scholars, and members of the public with
  research inquiries are welcome to consult the personal papers and university
  archives in the Special Collections Department of the University of Idaho
  Library. Special Collections materials are non-circulating. Their use is
  limited to the Special Collections reading room during regular <a href="visiting.html">hours</a>.
</p>

<p>Because of the often times fragile or unique character of the materials
  in Special Collections, great care must be taken in their use. For this
  reason, the collection is non-circulating. Photocopying is available but
  can be permitted only when it will not harm the material and is permitted
  by federal copyright law. Smoking, eating, drinking and the use of pens
  are all prohibited in the reading room. Users of the materials must register
  upon entering the Special Collections Department. A knowledgeable staff
  and a variety of finding aids are available to assist researchers and retrieve
  materials for study.</p>
