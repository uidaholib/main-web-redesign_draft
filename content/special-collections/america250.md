### Statement of Purpose

America250 at University of Idaho will be a yearlong endeavor to meaningfully engage with national efforts to mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The America250 at U of I committee seeks to raise awareness, spark conversation, and thoughtfully commemorate this milestone in our shared history. 

Our committee is especially dedicated to fostering student-led engagement, and therefore is offering $10,000 in funding opportunities for student groups to organize programs or projects that connect to America250 on U of I campuses across the state.

### Potential Learning Outcomes

Funding is available for programs or projects that align with one or more of the following learning outcomes. 

1. **Appreciate the power of place**: The state of Idaho was created more than 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but America250 gives us an opportunity to consider the full history of the spaces we now call the United States, Idaho, and the Palouse. What have the last 250 years meant for the people who have called this place home and for the environment that supports these communities? What unique and important contributions has U of I made to the region or our nation? 

2. **Acquire new knowledge**: Education has been a cornerstone of American democracy from the earliest days because founders understood that a learned public was best positioned to care for themselves and their communities. American history offers countless compelling stories of overcoming challenges and finding success. How can knowing more about our past help lead to a prosperous future?  

3. **Reflect on shared values**: America was built on shared values, including those enumerated in the Declaration of Independence - humankind’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Bill of Rights is another example of the country’s long-standing commitment to unifying ideals. In times of division, it is useful to reflect on what unites Americans formally and informally. How can we bring people together around common values?   

4. **Explore the creation of history**: America’s past is multifaceted and complex. Historians and other scholars help us understand the past by contextualizing historic events or actors, bringing history to life through the power of stories. By investigating the types of evidence that historians use and how they interpret them, we can gain a clearer sense of how the American story is written and told across the country. How have documentaries, reenactments, tours, exhibits, digitalization, and more helped tell certain stories? 

5. **Broaden existing perspectives**: How can we see the same story from another person’s perspective? A promise of freedom, articulated in the Declaration of Independence, has drawn millions of people to the United States over the last 250 years. The multitude of people who have called America home have unique perspectives that can be attended to and which enrich our collective national story. How can we provide opportunities for our community to think about new ideas together? 

6. **Commemorate American experiences**: This moment in history is an invitation to reexamine all aspects of our shared experiences. What other events, moments, people, and places should we commemorate, explore, or discuss?

### About the Committee for America250 at University of Idaho

This committee has organized to support our institution, the University of Idaho, as it thoughtfully and meaningfully engages with the national effort to mark the semiquincentennial (or 250th anniversary) of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. We will draw on the expertise of our university colleagues and community partners to bring unique contributions to the broader state and national efforts. We will commit resources to elevating voices of the many people and communities who have been part of our region’s past and present. We will find ways to support colleagues as they organize annual programs so that they might incorporate America250 themes into their events or other activities. We will support student-led efforts to make the anniversary meaningful and productive.

This committee is chaired by Dulce Kersting-Lark (Head of University Library's Special Collections and Archives) and Dr. Rebecca Scofield (Chair of History Department).
