<p>The Idaho Biographical Index was an Access database compiled by members of SPEC many years ago. While not as extensive as the <a href="https://history.idaho.gov/searchable-indexes/">Idaho State Archive's index</a>, it provides some unique sources that can be found in the U of I Library. The index includes over 19,000 biographical references extracted from more than 50 books. The table below includes features to browse, sort, filter, and export the index data.</p>
