<h1>Documentation Strategies: A Decade (or More) Later</h1>

<p>
A paper presented at the annual meeting of the Society of American
Archivists, Washington, D.C., August 31, 1995.

August 21, 1995<hr>

<p>
Five years ago, for a joint meeting of the Northwest Archivists
and the British Columbia Archivists, I was invited to offer some
comments on &quot;Documentation Strategy,&quot; then (and still)
much discussed. Since I knew little about documentation strategy
at the time, I started doing some reading. And the more I read,
the more I was bothered. And before I found what it was that was
bothering me, I had completed an intellectual history of the concept.
This was later published as &quot;Collection policy or documentation
strategy: Theory and practice,&quot; [<i>The American Archivist</i>,
54:1 (Winter 1991) 44-52].
<p>
In this talk I suggested that while documentation strategy had
its theoretical benefits, it was better as an ideal than it was
as a practical guide. In fact, it seemed to me to offer the practicing
archivist little guidance beyond the themes of collection development
that had earlier been expressed. 
<p>
In my reading, I found that the basic concept of &quot;documentary
strategies&quot; was first expressed by Andrea Hinding in 1982,
although this was not immediately recognized by the later proponents.
Hinding's presentation and subsequent article built upon the work
of Jerry Ham and others in arguing for a more activist role for
archivists. From that prehistory and early beginnings, we moved
through what might be called the modern development of documentation
strategy as expressed by Helen Samuels, Richard Cox, Larry Hackman,
and others. These authors argued for a grand vision for the archivist,
that one should look up from and beyond the document box to the
broader world of documentation. 
<p>
As I noted, it was not this grand vision that I found troubling;
it was, as they say of the Devil, in the details. If you will
remember the definition presented at the beginning of the session,
&quot;Documentation Strategy&quot; requires an analysis of the
documentary universe, the establishment of a plan, and the development
of sufficient resources to effect the plan. For me the conceptual
problem this engendered involved the awkward fact that I already
was burdened with too many things to do. 
<p>
I work in a small shop with responsibility for rare books, historical
photographs, archives and manuscripts. In 1990, the year of my
presentation and perhaps an unusual year, my biggest problem was
figuring out where we were going to store the 1500 cubic feet
of Senatorial papers we had just received; a gift that would increase
our holdings by about a third. In addition, I was managing a NHPRC
project to catalog in MarcAMC all of the archival and manuscript
records in the state, and was gearing up to spend another $34,000
of federal money on a mining records processing project. Plus
I was selecting books, answering reference questions, writing
letters, attending committee meetings (including one planning
the remodeling of the entire library), and keeping the computers
running. Meanwhile, the proponents of documentation strategy seemed
to be telling me that I somehow wasn't doing enough to be a real
archivist.
<p>
At the end of December 1990 we had over 6000 linear feet of records;
but only 59% had been processed. (At the end of June of this year
we had trimmed that back to 5575 linear feet through discards
of nonessential records which offset new acquisitions. As a consequence,
we are now up to 65% processed. It is progress, but slow progress.)
But I was supposed to ignore this backlog, a good portion of it
inherited when I took the job, and set up a broad-based state-wide
committee to research and write a documentation plan. A committee,
I might add, that would attempt to dictate what my institution
would collect in a particular area. Lacking the resources to hire
even a student photo curator to organize a 36 foot photograph
backlog, I was supposed to divert money and time into asking for
help in determining what records I should collect. Lacking money
and time to travel on donor development trips (it is about ten
hours on the road to the other end of the state) I was supposed
to help identify potential donors for some other archives.
<p>
I thought then, and think today, that I already had more plans
than I could carry out. In particular, I was not finding the time
for &quot;(1) choosing and defining the topic to be documented,
(2) selecting the advisors and establishing the site for the strategy,
(3) structuring the inquiry and examining the form and substance
of the available documentation, [nor] (4) selecting and placing
the documentation' as mandated by the documentation strategists.
[Samuels, &quot;Who controls the past.&quot; <i>AA</i>, 49:2(Spring
1986)116.] While I might have thought that participating in a
state-wide archival cataloging project meant that I was &quot;examining...the
available documentation&quot; [p.120] I would have been wrong.
&quot;Documentation strategies...do not start with surveys of
available material. They begin with detailed investigations of
the topic to be documented and the information required.&quot;
[p. 120] 
<p>
At least that was the idea; in practice, of course, I didn't,
I couldn't start there. I was, as the bumper-sticker says, too
busy fighting off the alligators to worry about draining the swamp
(which is about as politically incorrect as a bumper sticker can
get these days, what with endangered species and fragile wetlands).
<p>
Accordingly, my review of documentation strategy suggested that
it had more value as a theoretical construct than as a practical
guide (or strategy) for the day to day work of the archival repository.
While it is important to keep one eye on the universe of documentation;
it is also important to remember that we all work under resource
limitations. A strategy is an action plan, while a theory is a
way of explaining things. What documentation theory explains is
that small things are parts of big things, and we need to pay
attention to the larger whole as well as the smaller part.
<p>
I believe we are now at the stage best described as the post-modern
period (in the chronological, not the lit-critical sense) of documentation
strategies. We can begin to separate the underlying concepts from
the strategic planning; we can better evaluate the goals and objectives
in comparison to the costs. 
<p>
If we focus merely on the strategy we find, with Angelika Menne-Haritz
that &quot;the underlying premises of all [content-oriented approaches
to appraisal questions] is that archives aim at shaping as true
as possible an image of society. But,&quot; she adds, &quot;the
raw material that we must work with does not conform to those
ambitions.&quot; [&quot;Appraisal or documentation: can we appraise
archives by selecting content?&quot; <i>American Archivist</i>,
57:3(Summer 1994)541] It is also the case that the archivists'
job is to bring order out of chaos, a subject I treated in my
&quot;Entropy and archival disorder.&quot; [<i>Provenance</i>,
2:1 (Spring 1984) 94-99.] Thus archives are a representation of
society. There is not, and can not be a one-to-one relationship
between the larger society and its documentation. The map is no
longer useful when it is the same size as the surface it maps.
<p>
Terry Eastwood notes, as well, that &quot;archives are never a
complete record of actions, only those for which memorial is needed.
This alone should destroy notions of archives capacity 'to document
society' or in any way provide a full record of the past.&quot;
[Terry Eastwood, &quot;What is archival theory and why is it important?&quot;
<i>Archivaria</i>, 37(Spring 1994)130]
<p>
Hans Booms once advocated something similar to documentation strategy.
In 1991, at the Association of Canadian Archivists meeting at
Banff, he recanted. He noted that his attempts in the 1970s to
create what he called a &quot;documentation plan&quot; were not
only never implemented in Western Europe but were completely rejected
by his colleagues. In addition, key points of his plan, he recognizes
now, were unworkable. His example was the advisory review board,
which based on his over twenty years of unhappy experience working
with historical advisory boards and commissions, he was inclined
to withdraw. And, he added, where such a plan had been adopted,
as in East Germany &quot;not a single file had been appraised
using the 'profile of a documentation framework.'&quot; [Hans
Booms, &quot;Uberlieferungsbildung: Keeping archives as a social
and political activity.&quot; <i>Archivaria</i>. 33(Winter 1991-92)28-29.]
<p>
Others offer a more &quot;methodological opposition to 'documentation
strategy.'&quot; Richard Brown of the National Archives of Canada
has proposed &quot;a research agenda to facilitate the appraisal
of constituent documentation based on strains of archival-historical
value in relation and reference to provenance&quot; within the
context of a &quot;pre-defined, clearly delineated information
universe or jurisdiction.&quot; [Brown, Richard. &quot;Records
acquisition strategy and its theoretical foundation: the case
for a concept of archival hermeneutics.&quot; <i>Archivaria</i>,
33(Winter 1991-1992)36.] This is a far cry from the all-inclusiveness
proposed by some. We could almost say that the difference between
a documentation strategy and such a records acquisition strategy
is that the first attempts, like the Dewey Decimal system, to
bring order to the entire universe and the second, like the Library
of Congress classification, to organize a known entity. The fractal
nature of documentation, with its links to other documents, to
other processes, and to other activities, resists the easy drawing
of boundaries.
<p>
Luciana Duranti, tongue firmly in cheek, described the ultimate
effect of a successful documentation strategy program: &quot;Considering
that all archival bodies are interrelated, at the point that Russian
archivists can even talk of the 'unitary archival fonds of the
state,' we can view our societal archives as one large archives,
and the entire archival profession as its archivist.&quot; [Luciana
Duranti. &quot;The concept of appraisal and archival theory.&quot;<i>
American Archivist</i>, 57:2(Spring 1994)343.] Imagining this
&quot;unitary archival fonds&quot; will give some archivists the
courage to continue in the face of the manifold obstacles archivists
now encounter; it will give others nightmares of entire range
of new obstacles and disappointments. 
<p>
As I pointed out, documentation strategies, as a tool for active
archival involvement in documentation issues and archival accessioning,
do not work in the real world. The universe is too vast, the would-be
cooperators each have their own agenda, the eyes of the funding
agencies eventually glaze over. A documentation strategy, as proposed,
can not be done by one institution in isolation, it can not be
done without additional resources, and it cannot be done in a
world of archival poverty. Nevertheless, we still have those proclaiming
documentation strategies as a great leap forward on both practical
and conceptual grounds.
<p>
The theoretical construct of documentation strategy has a powerful
intellectual pull and requires more careful consideration. Even
experienced, hard-headed archivists have touted its benefits.
We are all optimists of a sort, or we would not place as much
emphasis as we do on the importance of documentary materials to
our culture and to our perception of our society. Documentation
strategy is a great idea (or complex of ideas) and well worth
the reams of paper and resources spent upon it. Its virtues are
the same as those elucidated by Richard Cox back in 1989: &quot;as
an analytical construct [enabling] us to look at the broader issues
of identification and selection of historical records.&quot; [Cox,
&quot;Documentation Strategy case study<i>.&quot; American Archivist</i>,
52(Spring 1989)200; supplemented by his more thorough analysis
in &quot;The Documentation Strategy and Archival Appraisal Principles:
A Different Perspective.&quot; <i>Archivaria</i>, 38(Fall 1994)11-36.]
But this theoretical component must be divorced from the (im)practical.

<p>
This stance differs from that of Terry Cook who suggests that
the strategy may be a worthwhile mechanism for locating overlooked
fonds, but it falls down as theory. He argues that &quot;it is
not thus far a successful theoretical integration of functionalism
and structuralism into a model of societal dynamics.&quot; [Terry
Cook, &quot;Documentation Strategy.&quot; <i>Archivaria</i>, 34(Summer
1992)186, 188.] Since I have trouble seeing how documentation
strategy works in the real life world of many archivists; I am
easily convinced that as theory, documentation strategy has major
flaws.
<p>
In most cases, real life documentation strategies barely involve
archivists at all. Joan Warnow-Blewett's account of the American
Institute of Physics program and Ellen Garrison's stories of upstate
New York are both illustrative. The AIP program, for example,
started and operated without any archival input for over a decade.
The New York project began with more of an archival component
but has never been fully staffed with the nine regional archivists.

<p>
As another example, a recent article in the <i>Chronicle of Higher
Education</i> reported on a wonderful documentation project. Entitled
&quot;Behind the Veil: African American Life in the Jim Crow South&quot;
this Duke University project has many of the features of a documentation
strategy. Relying solely in the <i>Chronicle</i>'s account we
see that the project resulted from a conference at Duke five years
ago where &quot;scholars began to recognize that a generation
of African Americans who had lived most of their lives under segregation
would [soon] pass away....&quot; The principal investigator of
this primarily oral history project is a professor of history
at Duke and the coordinating is being provided by their Center
for Documentary Studies; an instructive choice of naming. Teams
of graduate students from a number of colleges and universities
are doing the interviewing. Funding is provided by the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the Ford and other foundations.

<p>
But what of the archival involvement? The interviews and photographs,
the article says, will be placed in Duke's Special Collections
with copies in other institutions such as Norfolk State University.
The latter's archivist is quoted as saying, and this is a real-world
touch, &quot;We are willing recipients of the fruits of their
labor.&quot; [<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>. (August 18,
1995)A6-A7]
<p>
This important and timely project will, of course, provide a great
deal of documentary materials to the archives involved. It may
even open up some collecting avenues. But it is not an archival
project. In fact, it appears to proceed on the basis that there
are no documentary records from this period or that they are inadequate
for the study of this peculiar phenomenon. It is likely that this
latter point was strongly stressed in the grant application.
<p>
When I say that this is not an archival project, I mean that archival
principles and concerns are not central to the project. The fact
that it will produce or identify documentary material is a side-effect.
The project's goals include books, exhibits, college courses,
and a documentary film, not archival materials. Viewed in this
light, we begin to see Terry Eastwood means when he says, &quot;the
view of the archivists as engineers of the documentary record
of the past [a fundamental assumption of documentation strategy,
eliminates any] possible claim for a separate discipline or profession
of archivists. So the views of [such proponents] are anti-archival.
They undermine alike a proper conception of archives and the development
of the profession.&quot; [Terry Eastwood, &quot;Nailing a little
jelly to the wall.&quot; <i>Archivaria</i>, 35(Spring 1993) 251,
n.16.]
<p>
When evaluating the validity of the theory behind the documentation
strategy concept, it is best to stick more closely to archival
issues. I believe that this analysis is going to have to contend
with what has been called &quot;the adequacy of archival documentation.&quot;
[Larry Hackman and Joan Warnow-Blewett. &quot;The documentation
strategy process: A model and a case study.&quot; American Archivist,
50:1(Winter 1987)45.] I will leave to others the effort to propose
an effective theory that both establishes archival principles
and offers a meaningful action plan for archivists and archival
repositories.
<p>
So what then remains of the documentation strategy for the individual
archivist? As I stated in 1990, archivists will be well served
by &quot;an analysis of institutional holdings, a carefully written
collection development plan, an appraisal policy, [and] knowledge
of -- if not full cooperation with -- other repositories in the
region.&quot; [Abraham, p. 52] Yes, these activities were well-known,
but the emphasis and discussion on documentation strategy has
reinforced their importance. 
<p>
And what remains for the profession is to incorporate the documentation
universe into its arsenal of conceptual tools; to create a theory
we can use in planning, budgeting, appraisal, processing, and
reference. Since archival theory so often derives from practice,
we can hurry this process along by honing documentation strategies
toward that archival edge that will make the our jobs easier.
