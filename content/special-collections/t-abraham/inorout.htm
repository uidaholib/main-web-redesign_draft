Prepared for the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Society of American
Archivists, Atlanta, October 2, 1988<hr>

<p>
Recently I spent about a year in Washington, D. C. as member of
the staff of the Access category of the Reference Materials Program
in the Research Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
This is the unit of NEH which makes the bulk of awards to archival
institutions. Because I served as an IPA (in effect I was loaned
to the Endowment by my home institution; the University of Idaho)
my experience was tempered by the fact that I was not a career
employee and that I would be leaving at the end of my term. This
is, in fact, one of the chief reasons for the success of the IPA
program. {For more information about the IPA experience, see the
SAA Newsletter, January 1988. To volunteer for consideration,
write and send a copy of your vita.}
<p>
The nature of this assignment gave me the framework for today's
presentation. I was outside looking in, then inside looking around,
and -- later -- inside looking out. What follows are my observations
from those three vantage points.
<h2>OUTSIDE LOOKING IN</h2>

<p>
Like a goodly percentage of you, I am an unsuccessful applicant
to NEH. I have gone through the trial of writing an application,
sending off twenty-some copies, and waiting anxiously for nearly
a year to find out whether I was successful or not. I do not recall
that experience with any enthusiasm, particularly since I was
unsuccessful. As a result, I think I would have categorized my
impressions of NEH as relatively unfavorable.
<p>
All of the evils we naturally associate with the federal government
would probably have sprung to mind if I had been asked. I was
most strikingly aware of the formidable application guidelines.
It was very unlike the two-page letter of application considered
sufficient for some private foundations; NEH wanted twenty pages
of narrative, vitas of everybody and their pets, a budget form
that was about as confusing as anything I had ever seen (now much
improved), plus they wanted three (and now eight) suggested reviewers.
The time spent in writing, rewriting, and rewriting the application
(and then doing it again for the budget -- this was before spreadsheets
made budgeting simpler) was considerable.
<p>
Added to the impressive requirements of filling out an application
was the absolutely mysterious process of decision. Why did they
get accepted and I get rejected? Was it geography, size, politics,
subject, or methodology? How important was just plain dumb luck?
Yes, I asked for, and received, an explanation of the reasons
for the rejection but the process itself was quite mysterious.
<p>
These elements added up to a feeling that the Endowment, like
other federal agencies, was bureaucratic, insensitive, and monolithic.
Most of all, perhaps, it was that feeling of powerlessness, of
having no idea what was going on or how to find out.
<p>
Those were my impressions as best as I can recall them. I never
submitted another application but I did continue to receive proposals
for review; in one week several years ago I received five (a burden
the staff took pains to avoid this past year). In general, however,
I did not pay too much attention to the Endowment except in so
far as it affected my friends and colleagues and the profession.
Then I got this telephone call from Pat Nolan asking if I would
be interested in working at the Endowment for a year.
<h2>INSIDE THE ENDOWMENT</h2>

<p>
An IPA assigned to the Research Division is treated, from day
one, as a fully functioning member of the staff. As such, I was
engaged in the work of a Program Officer almost before I was able
to figure out what that entailed. There were efforts to provide
orientation -- some more formal than others -- but in the main
it was on-the-job training. What I found was an office environment
fully as primitive as the least of the state agricultural colleges.
Modular office cubicles with neck high partitions sometimes looked
like western groundhog villages as heads popped up and down at
their desks. The size of each cubicle is allocated by grade, you
can literally tell how important someone is by the square footage.
Office automation at the Endowment seems stuck in 1975. Program
officers have to laugh at applicants who offer to provide samples
of their project on disk or by modem; those now common-place objects
-- the personal computer -- are as scarce as Pepsi here in Atlanta.
And where I had thought of the Endowment as monolithic -- a natural
impression when seen from 3000 miles away -- I quickly discovered
it was actually comprised of jealously guarded individual fiefdoms.
Add to all this the fact that the Old Post Office is a multiple-use
historic structure with fast-food booths, tourist shops, and noon
musical entertainment at the lower levels -- and where the smells,
energy, and sounds rise up on some days to overwhelm the more
prosaic offices on the upper floors -- it turns out that the Endowment
is quite an interesting place to work. And I should add that the
staff are terrific people to work with.
<p>
Program officers at the Endowment have several roles: they serve
as advisors to potential grantees (you are encouraged to consult
with the staff and to send in a draft of your application about
two months before the final deadline), as facilitators of the
review process (selecting reviewers from the eight applicant supplied
names and adding others, identifying potential panelists, summarizing
evaluator's comments for the National Council's deliberations),
administering existing grants (dealing with queries, extensions,
renewals, supplements and emergencies; reading performance reports,
undertaking site visits), and -- in whatever time remains -- revising
the program guidelines and developing new initiatives. It can
be a challenging and fulfilling job and one with both satisfactions
and disappointments.
<p>
Accordingly, I learned a lot about the Endowment's processes and
found that my preconceptions were far wide of the mark. It is
possible for an outsider to find out how the Endowment works,
I found; as a staff member I assisted in the rewriting of the
divisional and program guidelines which provide, over and over,
a brief but complete statement of the process of application,
review and decision making. They stress (and this emphasis has
substantially increased in recent years) the requirement that
the project be of national significance for research in the humanities.
If anything, this could be said to be the overriding concern of
the Division of Research Programs.
<p>
What is also clearly stated, but perhaps not so apparent to the
reader, is that there is intense competition for a limited number
of award dollars. In the Access category there were requests for
over $20 million; we had slightly more than $2 million to disburse.
In this kind of environment, questions of significance are answered
by the evaluations of the specialist reviewers and the panelists.
According to Neil Harris, in a recent &#167;History News&#167;,
the peer review process is a killer of innovative projects, the
modern version of the &quot;death of a thousand cuts.&quot; On
the other hand, it should be evident that no matter how meritorious
the project's idea might be, there is no point in awarding money
if it is clear that the applicant doesn't have any idea how to
undertake the project.
<p>
What is not quite so clear from the publications and brochures
is the essential fairness of the review process. In the main,
the evaluation of a proposal rests on the reviewers and panelists.
Some of the reviewers are suggested by the applicant. Some are
selected by the staff. That kind of a split ensures that the reviewers
are not all friends and relations of the applicant nor are they
staff-selected &quot;swat teams.&quot; The staff, in fact, tries
to ensure that each proposal is reviewed by specialist scholars
in the field -- whether that field is 19th century American labor
or 16th century European dance or 13th century Balinese literature
-- and by archivists, librarians, bibliographers and others with
methodological expertise. I found that the latter frequently have
strong subject expertise and are willing to venture an opinion
on the scholarly significance of a project while scholars -- particularly
academic scholars -- are reluctant to address the methodological
issues. &quot;I think this is a fine idea but you'll have to ask
the archivists if it is feasible,&quot; is a frequent response.
<p>
No proposal will be recommended for funding unless it has received
the overwhelming endorsement of the reviewers and panelists. And
the obverse is equally true. No proposal will receive an award
if it has been rejected by all the evaluators. However, there
are two caveats to that statement. The first is that frequently
more applications are recommended for approval than funds exist.
Accordingly, only a portion of those with the highest rankings
will receive an award.
<p>
The second caveat is that, by virtue of the enabling legislation,
all funding decisions are made by the Chairman who is free to
accept or reject any of the recommendations made by staff, reviewers,
panelists, or the National Council on the Humanities. I am not
aware of any case in which the Chairman overturned a unanimous
recommendation.
<p>
Given the importance of the reviewers to this process, let me
encourage you to give thoughtful and careful consideration to
any proposals sent to you. Your analysis and recommendations are
of critical importance. It is extremely frustrating to have requested
eight or nine reviews and to receive back only one or two. I realize
that the review (hopefully not five at a time) lands on your desk
unsolicited and many have complained that they would have appreciated
being phoned first. Last year we had 166 applications; we requested
at least eight reviews for each application; this totals over
1300 reviews requested in about a month's time. Advance telephone
calls are just not feasible.
<h2>LOOKING OUTSIDE</h2>

<p>
Given all the above, what would I recommend to potential applicants?
First, ask for the program information; read everything very carefully.
Each word in the guidelines has been evaluated and reevaluated
for content and meaning year after year. Note particularly statements
about competitiveness. Frequently, that kind of a statement is
not intended to bar a project from the competition; it merely
suggests that the proposal has to be extraordinarily strong to
be successful.
<p>
Consult with the program staff; phone numbers are in the division
guidelines. They can answer specific questions about eligibility,
competitiveness, and significance. But when the staff suggests
that a bibliography of Elvis sightings is unlikely to be competitive,
I would encourage you to take that suggestion seriously. Remember,
it is to the staff's advantage to encourage strong proposals.
As I mentioned before, plan ahead sufficiently so that you have
time to send in a draft proposal. Read the staff comments carefully
but remember that they are making suggestions based on their experiences.
The reviewers and panelists, in all likelihood, will make additional
criticisms. If those are sufficient to keep your project from
being funded, do not despair. Write and ask for the evaluator's
comments. Let them help you revise the proposal. As I've said
many times, it may be the most expensive free advice you'll ever
get. Send in another draft. Try again. As one applicant stated,
he had learned that &quot;persistence is the mother of subvention.&quot;
However, if the reviewer's comments make it clear that the proposal
has a fatal flaw (or two or three) then you might consider dropping
that one and working up a different kind of proposal.
<p>
In either case, remember that you are asking for an expenditure
of public funds and your application needs to justify its request
for those funds in accordance with agency guidelines. And, in
areas where national standards (such as MARC AMC) exist, your
proposal must follow those standards or persuasively argue why
the standards are not applicable in this specific case. If you
can justify an exception, then go ahead; but it has to be convincing.
<p>
Some applicants are particularly concerned with the Endowment's
track record; they want to know what grants have been awarded
in a particular area to see if there has been a programmatic emphasis
that they can capitalize on. While I think it is interesting to
review the list of past awards (you can write and ask for them)
I am not sure that such an analysis would be very fruitful. Each
year, the review process is different. Different applications,
different reviewers, different panelists, and, frequently (in
the IPA position at least), different staff.
<p>
Looking at the award list from another angle leads to a slightly
different observation. Since the Endowment started making awards
to archival projects in earnest about fifteen years ago, the archival
world has changed substantially. And I would follow Margaret Child's
suggestion (in &#167;Library Trends&#167;, Summer 1987) that it
has changed in large part because of the impact of federal dollars
-- through NEH and NHPRC. NEH has funded some of the most important
and significant archival projects in recent years. The women's
sources survey, the SAA security, automation, publications, and
conservation initiatives, the Pennsylvania Railroad project, the
New York State records survey, and a host of others. I was struck,
in looking over the list, by how many of the dominant individuals
in this field are or have been NEH project directors. And I suspect
that a substantial proportion of the current generation of archivists
present at this meeting, got their boost in the profession through
working on federally funded projects.
<p>
How to repay that debt to the profession? By letters of support
to your senators and representatives. By working in our institutions
and in our states to support the importance of the humanities.
Each of us has benefited; each of us can help.
<p>
The final word I wish to leave with you today is what I call the
worst curse scenario. For all that have applied to NEH for funds,
and for all the hassles involved in the application process, it
pales in comparison with actually having to operate and administer
a grant. Getting the award might be the worst thing that could
happen to you. Thank you. <hr>
