<h1>INTERNET: On (Line) the Road Again</a>
</h1>

in short order. It is offered here merely as a historical curiousity.</i>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

<p>
The INTERNET is a loosely affiliated network of computer systems
which include military and commercial research centers and academic
computer centers; such as are home to big mainframe computers,
including super-computers. As such, the INTERNET functions something
like the interstate highway system. As a network, it permits users
to log on to remote systems across the country. Telecommunications
and computer technology have established a national and international
system that empowers all users on the network by providing a thoroughfare
to remote sites.
<p>
For librarians, especially academic librarians with access to
the campus computer system, the nearly forty academic library
catalogs available become a major resource for reference, cataloging,
and collection development. In addition, many libraries provide
additional local databases which are useful to others.
<p>
The first question you might ask is, given the rising costs of
long-distance telephone service, how much are these cross-country
connections going to cost. As it turns out, the cost of the long-distance
connection is zero; the cost is picked up in the overhead (and
grants) of the respective computer centers. And, since the long-distance
connection itself uses relatively few local cpu's (computer processing
units, which are billed at thousands of dollars per hour) the
total cost is probably less than a buck. And the network itself
functions to increase cooperation by not billing the remote user
for access. Accordingly, it is frequently cheaper to check the
catalog at Berkeley than the dial-up port of the local university
catalog. In this respect, libraries have not yet attained the
higher consciousness evidenced by the computer centers in that
many (billed hard dollars by the computing centers) pass on those
charges to users. In addition, some special services, such as
CARL's Uncover, are only available by subscription and the payment
of licensing fees.
<h2>Access</h2>

<p>
Access to the INTERNET is through the institutional mainframe
(with an INTERNET portal) which usually requires a USER-ID, PASSWORD,
and ACCOUNT NUMBER. Many universities subsidize student and faculty
use of the computer by billing against allocations (although considered
computer funny-money it is essential for allocating cpu resources)
which makes the cost to the individual user, again, zero.
<p>
Once equipped with an ID and PASSWORD and having learned the basics
of signing on and getting accustomed to extremely awkward user
interface (at least for those familiar with PC software), the
first step is to open up the link to the network. One version
of this command is TCPLNK which probably means something like
Transfer Command Protocol LiNK.
<p>
Next, issue the TELNET command to address the specific remote
host. The form is TELNET &lt;ADDRESS&gt; where &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
is one of two forms: the domain name or the ip address. The domain
name is in the form MELVYL.UCOP.EDU while the ip address is more
like a zip code: 31.1.0.11 (both examples are for the University
of California's on-line catalog). Some systems require the &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
be in the domain form while others need the ip address. The WHOIS
command (as in WHOIS MELVYL.UCOP.EDU or WHOIS 31.1.0.11) should
provide the alternate form, although this did not work for me.
<p>
This logs you on to a foreign computer which can be accessed just
as if it was in your own neighborhood; at least if you've managed
to match your hardware and software with their expectations. Clifford
Lynch in a recent article on designing library catalogs for INTERNET
access provided a glimpse of some of the problems that can arise.
<p>
First among these is hardware. The variety of hardware devices
used to access computer systems is quite large in part because
each technological advance must be evaluated for its effect on
the existing user base. In the 1950's the television industry
was considering whether to adopt color technology that was consistent
with black and white (and thus could be viewed on a black and
white set) or to change to a technically superior system that
would disenfranchise all b&amp;w sets or require broadcasters
to set up two transmitters. The choice was made to maintain backward
compatibility over better resolution.
<p>
The console interface to a mainframe computer has the same problem.
Some users are still using twenty-year old teleprinters to make
their connections while others have upgraded to the newest, multi-key,
super-resolution display technology. Some are using hard-wired
terminals perfectly matched to the host computer and others are
dialing in with a PC and generic communications software. As a
result, it is not a given that your connection with the remote
computer will appear on your screen with any kind of legibility
or that you will be able to respond to its prompts.
<p>
Some of this is the result of variations in software, particularly
if you are using one or another form of terminal emulation. A
hardwired terminal offers the most security in matching terminals
to systems. Even this is no guarantee if the remote system does
not support the terminal you are using. Those dialing in from
a PC with communications software are caught in an even stranger
circumstance. Not only is the terminal display software dependent,
the PC keyboard is usually remapped to a specific emulation. If
prompted to hit the PF-7 key, you must know that in your emulation
this means to hit ESC-7. Discovering these codes and changes can
be something like asking for a restroom in Bulgaria equipped only
with a French-English dictionary.
<p>
There are two standard software emulations provided in communications
programs: ASCII and VT100. ASCII is primarily used for PC-based
BBS calling at 8-N-1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) while
VT100 is more common calling mainframes which usually are set
at 7-E-1 (7 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit). VT100 is based
on a Digital Equipment Corporation standard hardwired terminal.
<p>
In the common VT100 emulation in PC communication software Procomm
2.4.2, the terminal function keys (PF1-PF12) have been remapped
to &lt;ESC 1&gt;-&lt;ESC =&gt; or the top twelve keys. F1 and
F2, however, work just like &lt;ESC 1&gt; and &lt;ESC 2&gt;. The
VT100 key command CLEAR is issued as &lt;SHFT F8&gt; but can also
be replicated in some modes by &lt;ESC .&gt;. This is particularly
useful when you see the HOLDING message at the bottom right of
the screen. ENTER, a common mainframe command, is not the keyboard
Enter or Carriage Return key (at least not always) but &lt;SHFT
F10&gt; or &lt;ESC O M&gt; (the letter O and not zero). PF4 is
sometimes used as part of a logoff sequence (such as at Texas
A&amp;M) and must be entered as &lt;ESC O S&gt;. Little of this
makes any intuitive sense and much of it is not clearly documented.
It is also useful to log each session to disk (&lt;ALT-F1&gt;
in Procomm) for later review.
<p>
Another problem with the hardware/software combination is the
screen display. Aside from garbage characters (&quot;happy faces
from hell,&quot; according to one wag) I have encountered invisible
menus (BOOTES.UNM.EDU) as well as the more common screen length
anomaly. Procomm, as do many communication software programs,
reserves the bottom screen line for a status display. Many systems
send 23 of 24 lines, prompt for response, clear screen and print
one more line, then wait for another response. After twelve screens,
there is no relationship between what the designer imagined you
would see and what is visible on the screen. At its best this
is merely an annoyance; at its worst it becomes impossible to
coordinate responses with prompts.
<p>
Usually a call to the local university mainframe starts with a
request for terminal type to which the response is almost automatically
VT100. Using the INTERNET gateway to call another mainframe results
in another request that you specify terminal type. Entering VT100
at this point may not be the best choice because of the nature
of the transmission of signals through the TELNET structure. I
don't know why this is so, but it is. Some remote systems (and
probably your local system as well) will list allowable terminal
types if you enter a &quot;?&quot; or &quot;HELP&quot; at the
prompt. The choices can range from VT100 to TYPETERM to UNKNOWN
to TINCAN. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to change it after
the session has started; although you might try the command SET
TERMTYPE UNKNOWN. Experimenting to find the best one is frequently
a matter of signing on, checking how it works, signing off, signing
on under another form, and so on. Part of the difficulty is that
different systems have different ground rules for terminal types.
For example, one system offers a VT100 option as locally modified.
Accordingly, its responses can be unexpected. Others seem to offer
no alternative save a perfect match. The University of Oregon's
JANUS catalog requires users to be either VT100, WYSE or TVI925
terminals. None of these correspond to Procomm's VT100 emulation.
<p>
Connections made through a PC modem using VT100 emulation will
often find a surprising amount of strange symbols (probably escape
codes for the visual display) cluttering up the screen if VT100
is chosen on the remote. In these cases, it is best to choose
the lowest common denominator terminal mode if possible. Promising
choices include UNKNOWN, TTY, HARDCOPY, TYPETERM, and sometimes
IBMPC.
<p>
Some of this depends on whether the connection through the INTERNET
is made in Line Mode or Transparent Mode. Line Mode appears to
be more common but a few systems connect at Transparent Mode.
The latter apparently use TN327x terminals which have (as near
as I can tell) lots of specially marked keys not available on
your PC. The different modes change the nature of the display.
They also change TELNET commands which are especially important
in logging off and exiting the remote system. Some systems, Michigan
State University, for example, offer two addresses; one for line
mode and one for transparent mode.
<h2>Logged On</h2>

<p>
Once logged on the remote system, it should be a matter of just
following the prompts, if any. However, the connection might be
directly to the library catalog or to some sub-computer at the
university. If it is the first, there are usually helpful screens,
menus, and clear prompts as most are designed to accommodate undergraduate
users. However, if it is the latter, it might be necessary to
wade through a jungle of confusion to reach the relative oasis
of the library catalog. For instance, the University of Kansas
sequence is as follows:
<p>
At &quot;Username:&quot; enter &quot;RELAY&quot; &lt;CR&gt;
<p>
At &quot;System?&quot; enter &quot;OCAT&quot; &lt;CR&gt;
<p>
At &quot;Terminal Type?&quot; enter &quot;?&quot; for a list of
acceptable types.
<p>
At &quot;Enter transaction&quot; enter &quot;OCAT&quot; &lt;CR&gt;
<p>
Just as it is necessary to step through (or log on to) successive
layers of the system, it is also important to back out through
each layer in logging off.
<p>
This is not always easy. Logging off of any remote system sometimes
seems impossible. Although a few systems provide an initial instruction
or list of commands, some offer you an exit choice at every command.
Some, however, expect you to not only know how to disconnect but
when. One system provides an exit code to be issued at its standard
prompt:_
<p>
At &quot;---&gt;&quot; enter &quot;EXIT&quot;
<p>
The response is &quot;Thank you for using our system.&quot;
<p>
And if you enter EXIT again it will thank you again. You've exited
but still don't know where in the system you are.
<p>
Among the possible exit commands are:
<p>
EXIT BYE X QUIT
<p>
END STop ESC, ####
<p>
% LOGOFF UNDIAL QUIT
<p>
Even for vendor supplied systems logoff commands are not necessarily
the same. If you are searching a NOTIS system, for instance, the
LOGOFF varies:
<p>
QUIT or EXIT DELCAT, University of Delaware
<p>
LOGOFF LUIS, Florida State University Systems
<p>
&lt;CTRL E&gt;%QUIT MIRLYN, University of Michigan
<p>
OFF ELIXIR, SUNY Binghamton
<p>
&lt;CTRL Z&gt; Texas A&amp;M Library
<p>
&lt;KEYPAD ENTER, PF4&gt; LUIS, University Texas Arlington
<p>
% LUIS, Northwestern University Library
<p>
In each case, however, this may only exit the library module and
not the INTERNET connection. Minnesota's NOTIS system, according
to Art St. George's &quot;Internet-accessible Library Catalogs
&amp; Databases &quot;...is considered by some to be relatively
difficult to use, involving complex logoff escape sequences, for
example. Be prepared to break the connection from your end, or
just hang up, if necessary.&quot;
<p>
Hanging up the remote is more complicated than just disconnecting
the call. Those systems that have no specific logoff command require
that you terminate the TELNET connection. This could be relatively
simple. A TELNET command line can be summoned in line mode by
hitting a function key other than PF1, PF2 or PF3. A &quot;?&quot;
will bring up a menu of choices; one of which is &quot;QUIT.&quot;
Therefore, in some systems, exiting is through a TELNET disconnect:
PF4, for instance, then QUIT.
<h2>Additional Resources</h2>

<p>
While access to multiple library catalogs is a tremendous benefit,
there are additional advantages to the INTERNET. There are, of
course, a variety of library-created databases and tools that
have been established on local systems, although many are restricted
to local IDs. While Dartmouth and CARL provide access to Grolier's
encyclopedia, these are not available to remote users. On the
other hand, Rensselaer offers an index to architectural slides
and IEEE articles. Carnegie Mellon includes local bibliographies
and indexes to architectural pictures, ICPSR data tapes, and has
proposed an index to artificial intelligence literature. Brown
University's Josiah offers expanded local indexes to its Special
Collections.
<p>
Some of the databases available on the INTERNET are not library
developed but are useful for special interests. These include
the Latin America and legal databases at the University of New
Mexico (connect with BOOTES.UNM.EDU and not LIBROS.UNM.EDU) and
the agricultural and extension information available from the
Pennsylvania Cooperative Extension. In addition, both Penn State
University and the University of Maryland offer informational
services about academic programs and activities at their campuses
through an on-line system that can be called through the INTERNET.
<p>
Once adept at roaming the INTERNET, it is easy to branch out into
additional byways of the national electronic system. BITNET is
primarily an electronic mail service for communications. However,
it has the capability to send the same message to thousands of
users. As a result, on-line magazines and forums have been established.
Of particular interest to librarians are the Public Access Computer
Systems Forum, chaired by Charles W. Bailey, and the Newsletter
on Serials Pricing Issues, edited by Marcia Tuttle. There is also
a wide range of &quot;magazines,&quot; &quot;newsletters,&quot;
and &quot;informational exchanges&quot; available electronically.
<p>
As useful as this broad range of tools might be, the barriers
to access are clearly quite high. Many mainframe users will find
the conventions and commands described here commonplace and can
be almost eloquent about which operating system requires which
obscure command. Many librarians will find all this daunting but
will persevere because of the obvious benefits. Others, students
and faculty, will not persist and will give up at the first blank
screen or unintelligible prompt.
<p>
As our bibliographic tools become larger, more elaborate, more
sophisticated, and more unfriendly, we will continue to distance
the user from the information. The librarian must continue to
mediate the search for knowledge. However, it should be remembered
that most library users never fully mastered the card catalog
either. <hr>
