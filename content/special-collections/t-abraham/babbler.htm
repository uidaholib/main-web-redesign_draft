<h1>From "Babbler" to Jimmy Ah Foo: The Chinese in Australian Humor</h1>

<p>Terry Abraham<br>
University of Idaho Library</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on a paper presented at the International Conference
on Quong Tart and his Times, The Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, July 4, 2004. An
earlier viersion was presented at the 57<sup>th</sup> Annual Northwest
Anthropological Conference, Eugene, March 26, 2004.</p>

<h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>

<p>Chinese miners and laborers entered Australia in great
numbers in the latter half of the nineteenth century. In spite of their
contributions to Australia's economy, they were discriminated against and
threatened with harm, actions which culminated in the adoption of the "White
Australia" policy soon after Federation in 1901. In the face of these
manifestations of racist behavior, many Chinese made a home in Australia,
established businesses and families, and became part of Australian daily life.
The Chinese presence in Australia was documented in jokes, humorous poems,
songs, and stories. </p>

<p>Chinese cooks served on stations in the bush while
entrepreneurs opened restaurants and shops in the cities and towns. Jimmy Ah
Foo, the Longreach, Queensland, publican, was one of the latter. Quong Tart's
punning humor was also recorded in the newspaper columns. They were both
featured players in Australian humor.</p>

<p>The jokes about the Chinese were part of a larger humor
tradition derived from the specific circumstances of Australian history. As
jokes often are, they were also the locus of ambivalent messages about the
Chinese and their place in Australian society. </p>

<p>This examination of a few jokes about the Chinese from the
Australian tradition will try to place them in their historical and cultural
context.</p>

<h2>Humor in Racism</h2>

<p>Here is perhaps the definitive Chinese joke in Australia.
Featuring a station cook in the outback,<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>
it appeared in print as a poem, "My
Other Chinee Cook," by James Brunton Stephens about 1885.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>
Another poem by Edwin Brady on the same topic was printed in the <i>Bulletin</i>
on March 18, 1893.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> It is stated
as a "true" story, introduced in one of his great compendiums of Australiana by
Bill Wannan: </p>

<p class="INDENT">The Chinese Cook</p>

<p class="INDENT">A folklore of comic yarns grew up around the
Chinese-Australians of the last century, as it developed around the "Cousin
Jack" Cornish miners, and the Italians on the canefields.</p>

<p class="INDENT">Here is one of the favourite tales that have long
been part of the tradition. This version comes from Miss E. Hudson Jones of
South Brisbane (Q.). It is worth noting, by the way, that the Australian poet
Brunton Stephens told the same anecdote in his popular verse "My Other Chinese
[Chinee, in the original] Cook".</p>

<p class="INDENT">"My old Dad," writes Miss Hudson Jones, "had he
lived would now be 95. He was an old hand-shearer in Queensland. He always
declared this story to be true.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"In the team to which the Dad belonged was a Chinese
cook. In those days, the shearers had to provide their own food supplies – 'to
tucker themselves', as they put it.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"This Chinese cook was just an ordinary, run-of-the
mill babbler<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> who turned
on corn-beef and damper<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>,
alternating with mutton
chops, with monotonous regularity. Still, he was clean and he wasn't
argumentative.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"At one station the shearers acquired a young cattle
bitch. Not much notice was taken of her until one day Brownie presented the
camp with a litter of six pups.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"After a week or two the tucker suddenly took a turn
for the better. The Chinese babbler served delicious stews and pies with a
unique flavour. These tasty meals went on for a time and then, just as suddenly
as they'd started, they ceased; and the camp went back to the dreary diet of
corn-beef, damper and tough old mutton chops.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"'What's happened, Johnny?' the men asked. 'Why
don't we get them real nice stews an' pies an' things?'</p>

<p class="INDENT">"Johnny spread his hands and shrugged his shoulders.
"No more puppy, no more pie,' he said with finality."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p>A puppy as food strikes us as unnatural, uncivilized, and
inhuman. All of which makes the surprise in the story funny, for the shearers
loved the cook's pies and wanted more. The idea of eating dogs and cats (what
we consider pets is not to be considered food) is a frequent motif in racist
jokes. Folklorist Christie Davies notes "to eat a member of a species kept as a
pet is in a minor way to infringe the taboos against cannibalism."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>
If those who eat pets are unnatural, uncivilized, and inhuman, then we don't
have to treat them as people. If we don't have to treat them as people, then we
can justify any number of actions which we would not (by law or custom) take
against "real" people. </p>

<p>That story is told second-hand, but is reported to be a true
occurrence. Sheep shearing is seasonal and migratory work. A team of shearers
would arrive at the sheep camp to do their work. According to the story, they
had to provide their own "tucker," or food. For this purpose they hired a
Chinese cook, "he was clean and he wasn't argumentative." Camp cooks were
generally portrayed as "hard-bitten individuals seemingly determined to poison
those they feed"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> so this one
was a prize of sorts. And when he cooked "puppy" the food was better than it
was otherwise. The "hero" of this story is undoubtedly the Chinese cook who, to
the surprise of the shearing crew, did his best to provide good "tucker."</p>

<p>In another story, presented as true and as a folktale, the
Chinese station cook gives as good as he got:</p>

<p class="INDENT">In the early part of 1921 we had a
Chinee cook there…. This Chinee cook was a fairly solid sort of a Chinaman with
a long black pigtail, long dungaree jacket, blue dungaree trousers and Chinese
slippers. The boys used to tease him a lot, and I could see that he was getting
sullen. I could see that he wouldn't stay there and cook for us, if they kept
annoying him.</p>

<p class="INDENT">I said, "Don't tease him so much,
boys, or we'll be lighting fires around the barracks and having to batch for
ourselves. Tell him you'll chop a bit of firewood for him. And stop pulling his
pigtail, and tell him he's a welly good cook and that you like him."</p>

<p class="INDENT">They said, "Do you think he'll go?"</p>

<p class="INDENT">I said, "You wouldn't cop it,
neither will he!"</p>

<p class="INDENT">So they said to Johnny, "No more
pullem pigtail, you welly good cook, we'll chop a bit of wood for you, we'll
dry dishes of a night for you." They was worried about having to cook for
themselves.</p>

<p class="INDENT">Johnny said, "No more teasem? No
more pullem pigtail?"</p>

<p class="INDENT">"No more!" they said.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"All li, no more me pee in the
soup," he said. He'd been giving them a tasty little drop in the soup. He'd
been getting square with them all the time.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>"Revengeful" is how Ouyang Yu describes this, referring to
it as "an old Australian yarn called Pee Soup about a Chinese cook who took
revenge by pissing in the soup of those migrants who teased him and pulled his
pigtail."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> Yet, it is
a revenge story told by whites to whites, featuring a Chinese man who affirmed
the saying: "Don't get mad, get even." Again, we see that the Chinese cook is
presented as the "hero."</p>

<p>Here's another story about cooks, featuring Jimmy Ah Foo,
who had a pub/hotel in Queensland:</p>

<p class="INDENT">"And there was the time, during the anti-Chinese
demonstrations of the last century, when shearers and other outback workers,
afraid that the 'foreigners' would break down their hard-won working
conditions, began agitating to have Chinese cooks removed from sheds, camps and
even hotels.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"A shearer's deputation went to Jimmy Ah Foo and
asked him to get rid of the Chinese cook he was employing. He promised to
consider the matter.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"When next the deputation approached him, Jimmy said
cheerfully, 'All li. I sack that cook. I do cooking meself now.'"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p>Jimmy Ah Foo is another anomaly, a Chinese man who is the
hero of a story that celebrates the racist attitudes of the majority
population. There are a number of stories about Jimmy Ah Foo; in each he is
recognized as a Chinese who has become part of the community, whose activities
and observations -- a character if there ever was one -- are incorporated into
the community story.</p>

<p>One characteristic of Australian humor,
anti-authoritarianism, has relevance here: "Australians frequently pride
themselves on their general irreverence towards authority."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>
As an Australian joke, Jimmy Ah Foo's impertinence to the union leaders is
deeply in character and therefore even more funny. Again, the "hero" is
Chinese.</p>

<p>Chinese market gardeners have long been a staple component
of Australian life.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a>
In 1899 it is reported that there were 5000 market gardeners in New South Wales
with 2000 of those in Sydney.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>
One, in the suburbs of Sydney, has been continually operated by the Chinese for
over a hundred years.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>
Accordingly, tales of market gardeners fit into an existing shared history.</p>

<p class="INDENT">The Chinese Gardener and His Horse</p>

<p class="INDENT">That honesty is the best policy is nowhere better
illustrated than in the following tale. </p>

<p class="INDENT">Many years ago there was a Chinese market gardener
who had a horse for sale. It was a handsome animal, fat and sleek.</p>

<p class="INDENT">A man came to look at it one day, and was very taken
with it. He asked the Chinaman its age, had a close look at its teeth, and
convinced himself that it was sound in wind and limb.</p>

<p class="INDENT">It surprised him, therefore, when the Chinese
gardener kept saying, "He not look too well."</p>

<p class="INDENT">"I can't say I agree with you," said the prospective
buyer. "He looks quite well to me. In fact, I'd say he's in excellent
condition."</p>

<p class="INDENT">The deal was completed and the man took the horse
away.</p>

<p class="INDENT">Several days later he came back, and angrily strode
up to the Chinese gardener as he tended his cabbages. "You didn't tell me that
horse was blind in one eye!" he roared.</p>

<p class="INDENT">"Yes I did," said the Chinaman blandly. "I tell you
he not look too well, didn't I?"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p>This is another example of the lowly Chinese presented as a
"hero" in a contest with a Caucasian. The story particularly sets the scene, in
contrast to the usual representation of the dishonest "other," by noting that
this is an example of "honesty is the best policy," which must be perceived in
this context as a majority virtue. </p>

<h2>Quong Tart</h2>

<p>As a fixture in the white community of Sydney, Quong Tart
was one Chinese man who seemed to have successfully integrated into the larger
community. In 1883 the <i>Bulletin</i> noted: "Mr. Quong Tart…is undoubtedly at
the present time, the most popular – or the only popular – Chinese in New South
Wales."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a>
He does not seem to have played the same role in the community -- the seemingly
naïve trickster -- as Jimmy Ah Foo. The "jokes" and stories relating to him,
again told by whites to whites as reported in the newspapers, depend less on
anecdotes and more on Quong Tart's personal sense of humor. Quong Tart's
English was clear enough, though Scots accented, that he would not be the
subject of a dialect joke. And it was good enough for Quong Tart to develop a
reputation as an inveterate punster, a task requiring excellent language
skills. </p>

<p>One story, however, relies for its effect on his accent, but
Quong Tart is himself neither the butt nor the hero of the story:</p>

<p class="INDENT">It was at Urana that Quong's accent attracted the
attention of another diner, an elderly Scotsman. Martin Brennan, with Irish
wit, introduced his companion as "a distinguished native of Aberdeen." The old
Scot peered more closely at the Chinese gentleman across the table and
responded: "He may be so. I have not been in Aberdeen since I was a child, and
cannot say what the people there are now like; but it seems to me they have
undergone a great change!"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p>On this same trip, during which Quong Tart and Brennan were
charged with investigating immorality in Chinese camps, Quong Tart's humorous
talk at an Urana banquet was recorded in the newspaper:</p>

<p class="INDENT">Every country has its great men – Greece produced a
Homer, Italy a Virgil, France a Fenelon, England a Shakespeare, and China
boasts of several renowned scholars, the greatest probably in intellectual
splendor, according to the ancient annals of China, being Shak Pah, who, for
all I know, might have been the great progenitor of England's celebrated bard.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p>Robert Travers' <i>Australian Mandarin: The Life and Times
of Quong Tart</i> includes several of Quong Tart's puns, two of which revolve
around his name:</p>

<p class="INDENT">[At a] luncheon to honour the Church of England
minister Rev Cakebread [it is reported] "Friends!" he quipped "You have no
taste for good things. You eat this cake and that cake until you're full – but
the real Cakebread and the genuine Tart you leave untouched!"</p>

<p class="INDENT">At one of his treats he refused to join his guests
in drinking wine, joking "No thanks. If I took more of that stuff, I shouldn't
be a Tart but a roly-poly!"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p>Again, we should note that these stories about Quong Tart
appeared originally in the mainstream press, they were jokes and stories that
whites told other whites. In these, and in the others reported, Quong Tart
appears as an exemplary character and civic embellishment. His wife reported in
her hagiographic biography of her late husband: "Quong Tart was a happy man.
…He was a ready-witted, mirth-provoking companion, and had ingrained in his
Anglicised Chinese composition a dash of the philosophical, which tended to
make him an agreeable and valuable auxiliary to any society. Sparkling with
fun, brimful of humour, Quong Tart created amusement wherever he went."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>
In addition, he exemplified the ambivalent attitude many Australians evidenced
towards their Chinese neighbors.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, in an ostensibly "racist" story told
by Caucasians to a Caucasian audience, the much-hated and reviled Chinese are
the "heroes;" they have turned the tale around so that the butt of the joke is
the white majority. This seems to fall outside the usual category of ethnic
jokes where the "other" is marginalized and denigrated. If we look past the
story itself to the historic context of the Chinese experience in Australia and
the nature of Australian humor we can catch a glimpse of some of the underlying
issues.</p>

<h2>Chinese immigration and Australian response</h2>

<p>A combination of circumstances, some economic, some
political, and some individual, drew thousands of Chinese (mostly males) to
Australia beginning soon after the discovery of gold in 1851. Forty years
later, over 40,000 Chinese were dispersed among several gold fields, often
making up more than half the population in the camps.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a>
They were first welcomed as contributors to the labor pool, but as time passed
and economic conditions changed, Caucasian workers increasingly saw them as
economic threats with an alien lifestyle. Anti-Chinese violence flared in
mining camps; attacks were made on Chinese residents, although not to the
extent of the violence expressed in the United States.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The establishment of a "White Australia Policy" after federation in 1901
restricted Chinese immigration severely. Australia's relative proximity to southeast
China encouraged a constant flow of Chinese to and from their homeland that
offset the lack of welcome in Australia. In spite of repressive political
actions, many Chinese became substantial contributors to the Australian economy
and culture, and subsequent generations of their families demonstrate a
continuing Chinese Australian presence. One such man, born in Bendigo in 1938
and quoted in <i>A Secret Country: The Hidden Australia</i>, noted with satisfaction the
acceptance his minority family realized in that former gold-mining community.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<h2>Ethnic and dialect humor</h2>

<p>English folklorist Christie Davies has made the point that
jokes (he speaks primarily of ethnic jokes, but the thought could be expanded
to most if not all jokes) follow scripts that are related to historical
circumstances.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> I would
call these scripts "shared suppositions." The scripts are the narrative
structure or theme of the joke (he analyzes several groups of paired but
contrasting scripts: stupid/canny and militarists/cowards, are but two examples).
These scripts are frequently based on historical circumstances; one of his
examples relates how, of all WWII participants, only the Italians became
identified (for joking purposes) as cowards. </p>

<p>The script of a joke relies on shared knowledge between the
teller and the listener to transmit the narrative of the joke. Jokes are told
in a kind of shorthand that assumes this shared narrative. For this reason,
jokes rely upon (and in some cases create) stereotypes; they apply
characteristics to groups that may be false but are believed to be true enough;
at least true enough for purposes of telling a joke. Otherwise, telling a joke
would require the kind of elaborate explication of subsidiary details that
occur when one is trying to "explain" a joke to someone who didn't get it. As
is often the case, the joke gets lost in the retelling; for the essential
character of the joke, a succinct premise with a surprising twist, vanishes
when explained. </p>

<p>That the script relies on a shared narrative is demonstrated
every evening after the news, when the late-night talk show "host du jour"
comes out and comments on the news, on stories much of the audience is already
familiar. Similarly, Australian jokes about the "new chum" or "bushrangers"
tend to need some explanation when told off their home ground.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this shared narrative is a recognized fiction,
using known stereotypes, and may not have any specific relationship to an
actual event, person, or group of persons.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>
For the sake of the story, of the joke, the teller and the listener must agree
on the basis of the story. </p>

<p>The history of the Chinese in Australia provides part of the
script underlying jokes told primarily by dominant Caucasians about Chinese at
the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Because
these jokes rely on stereotypes and racial expressions that are not common
today, many would be considered offensive. The use of "Chinaman" is now
recognized as a derogatory term because of its historical usage; today we would
say, "a Chinese person."</p>

<p>Accordingly, when we hear, or more likely read, a joke
beginning "The stockmen went to the Chinese cook…." we are expected to know
that there were Chinese in the bush, they were treated poorly, their knowledge
of English was often poor, that they were hired to fulfill domestic tasks in
part because of a shortage of willing women, and that the Chinese were
subservient or dependent in their relationships with whites. This was all part
of the shared script that the teller and the listener recognized and agreed
upon because it was based on historical circumstances.</p>

<p>Davies' analysis of ethnic jokes relies heavily on jokes
told by the dominant culture about "the other." Perhaps because of a lack of
sources, he concludes that jokes tend to rely on the center telling jokes about
the periphery.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> There were
undoubtedly jokes that the Chinese told each other, since all people (even
subordinate peoples) tell jokes, but they have seldom (likely never) been
recorded by the dominant culture. Accordingly, all these jokes about the
Chinese are told from the perspective of that dominant culture.</p>

<h2>Australian humor</h2>

<p>Australian humor is derived from the mythmaking of the
Australian character; what defines the nation is what defines their humor. This
is particularly true in both Australia and the United States, where the
dominant culture was originally an immigrant culture. Australian humor "draws
on historical experiences of convictism, pioneering and the bush and is bound
up with perceptions of the Australian character as egalitarian,
anti-authoritarian and irreverent towards social pretension…."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p>Brian Matthews, in the eminently readable <i>Oxford
Companion to Australian History</i>, expressed another view of Australian
humor: "there is a corrosive though not deeply wounding irony; there is a
spareness of words, a bush setting, a vernacular ambience." He adds: "Above
all, the humour is what one might describe as 'kidding': the butt of the remark
is being gently but firmly set up for a modestly humiliating fall."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a>
As part of the effort to help distinguish a national identity, Australian humor
has been characterized as "rough, deprecating, [and] sardonic."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a>
Folklore collector Bill Wannan notes its forebears among the transported Irish
settlers, whose crime was often political activism rather than theft, and from
the American gold-seekers:</p>

<p class="INDENT">The Americans who came to Australia in search of
gold or quick fortunes brought with them characteristic forms of national
humour – the tall story, the Joe Miller type of jest, the big talk and the
boastful manner. This kind of comic attitude appealed to the native-born
Australian who had himself, over half a century, evolved similar forms of
humour, notably the tall tale and the joke at the expense of the new chum.
Where the Australian differed was in his less boisterous manner, his more
subtle ways of boasting, and his more sardonic outlook.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p>The American miners, of course, brought more than their
sense of humor. They also brought an antagonistic attitude toward non-whites
that fueled and compounded the native racism found in Australia.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p>Most lists of the major themes of Australian humor -- mateship, the harshness of the bush, new chum bashing --  deny their underlying
racism by excluding it from consideration. As Dorothy Jones noted: </p>

<p class="INDENT">The myth of nationhood which it helps constitute
depends upon exclusion and elision for its very existence. Nations as imagined
political communities define themselves both in terms of their differentness to
what lies beyond their borders, that is other nations, and in terms of
differences within, so that certain groups, distinguished, say, by racial
background, are perceived to exist as separate enclaves which not only mark
them out from the dominant group, but, by their very existence, contribute to
an illusion of unity and homogeneity within that group.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Excluding minorities from the "group" helps the "group"
define itself as a group or community. The "social puzzle," as folklorist
Davies calls it, "is the paranoid hostility of the surrounding peoples, who have
proved all too willing to indulge in the persecution, expulsion, and even mass
murder of hapless and helpless minorities."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Leaving aside the treatment of the aboriginals (an extensive topic all its own)
the Chinese were generally treated and depicted viciously. </p>

<p>It is probably correct to say that the Australian locus of
both late nineteenth and early twentieth century humor and virulent
anti-Chinese sentiment was the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>. The weekly <i>Bulletin</i>
was adamantly "Whites Only," yet it was recognized as the source of some of the
best and most original Australian humour; it was also "the major forum for
Australian literature of its day."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>
Accordingly, it was the focal point of the creation of the national mythology
that all this relied upon.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a>
It was the <i>Bulletin</i> that crowed: "the European's dislike of the Chinaman
is not a matter of taste, but a healthy racial instinct….in the case of the
chinkies, this out-of-date instinctive dislike has lasted long enough to be
useful again as a protection against a race that is more dangerous to
civilisation than a savage with a club is to a fellow savage."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a>
</p>

<h2>Representations of the Chinese</h2>

<p class="INDENT">Shoals of pigtails, almond-eyed,<br>
Flooding all the country side,<br>
Skimmed off as their country's scum,<br>
Odorous of opium.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p>As in this example, one stanza of several, the racism,
hatred, and antagonism directed at the Chinese immigrants in Australia is
reflected in the literature. Poet and critic Ouyang Yu notes: "[the Chinese]
remained an odd, exotic sight on the Australian landscape, ignorant, funny,
docile and loyal to the master. They are not really what they are but what
Australians want them to be and they are represented as such, to suit the
purpose of assimilation and domination, as a result of racism and nationalism."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p>In a study of North Queensland humor, Cheryl Frost writes
that those who deviated from the norm -- this included "Chinese and aborigines,
newcomers to the region, and parsons" -- were particularly made the butt of the
more sophisticated jokes and tales.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a>
The less sophisticated jokers relied on practical jokes, crocodiles, multitudes
of mosquitoes, and other tales of exaggeration.</p>

<p>In some cases, the Chinese were merely background, a measure
of their significance to the society at large. In one humorous description, ostensibly
a newspaper editorial, the town's residents are listed: "boozy squatters,
snobbish wives of snobbish officials, anaemic old maids, obsequious tradesmen
on the verge of insolvency, and two respectable and hard working persons – the
latter are Chinamen."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a>
The virtuous Chinese are highlighted as a contrast to the other denizens of the
village; the evident sarcasm marks the description as humorous.</p>

<p>This ambivalence towards the Chinese affects the joke's
underlying racism. I have been told that "a joke is not racist if it is funny."
But what is funny, I would urge, depends on the host of circumstances
surrounding the participants, the joke, and the moral climate. A racist joke
that is perceived as "not funny" is racist, with all that implies.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>
The perception that matters in these cases is that of the minority victim, the
"butt" of the joke. As Frank Wu has pointed out: "What seems like benign
childish jokes to the majority can seem like an endlessly recurring nightmare
to a minority."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a> One example
would be the commonly reported teasing of the Chinese laundryman or gardener by
troops of small Caucasian boys who would grow up to commit more adult
harassments.</p>

<p>It is also important to recognize that jokes "are not social
thermostats regulating and shaping human behavior, but they are social
thermometers that measure, record, and indicate what is going on. To become
angry about jokes and to seek to censor them because they impinge on sensitive
issues is about as sensible as smashing a thermometer because it reveals how
hot it is."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In some cases, as Cheryl Frost noted, "the callous treatment
of the Chinese diggers by Europeans [was presented] in a two-edged way: they
looked on the victims with distaste, but simultaneously deplored their
fellow-settlers' injustice."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a>
The famed Australian poet Henry Lawson's line, "Some of my best friends are
Chinks!", demonstrates that mixed relationship.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Ivor Indyk, a Sydney academic, writing on migrant (also
called, just as erroneously, ethnic) humor, that is to say stories by the
minorities about their Australian experiences, notes of one such pidgin work:
"The joke, that is to say, is on the Australian reader, who might have thought
he was laughing at the migrant, when in fact it is his own superior standpoint
which has been subverted."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><sup>[47]</sup></a>
Yet, "for all its deflationary, irreverent quality, Australian humour is
usually an acknowledgement of the status quo."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title=""><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p>If, in Australia, it is true that the humor is based on what
Vane Lindesay has called "the fundamental... characteristic born of adversity -- 'You can't win,'"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title=""><sup>[49]</sup></a> then this
applies even more to the Chinese residents of Australia. They had what has been
called "a Chinaman's Chance" meaning no chance at all. Surprisingly, "A
Chinaman's Chance" is apparently a British phrase alluding to boxers with a
porcelain chin (the same as a glass jaw); it was carried to Australia and then
exported to the United States, rather than the other way round.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title=""><sup>[50]</sup></a>
More than most Australians, the Chinese were in a can't win situation. Even
perfect English would not get you past the language test for entry if the
examiner decided to test you in Welsh or German. The dictation test was adopted
soon after the "White Australia" policy was established in 1901; "it was
understood, though nowhere stated, that this should be in a language not known
to the immigrant."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title=""><sup>[51]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In the century since the proponents of Federation
successfully demonized the Chinese (and other Asians) for political benefit,
the Chinese-Australians have made substantial, and frequently recognized,
contributions to Australia's national identity. Therefore, it is significant
that an early 1990s compilation of Australian jokes contains only one
specifically related to Chinese-Australians.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><sup>[52]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Even so, as this brief summary demonstrates, the Chinese
were frequently presented in a comic, but not entirely unsympathetic, way. This
representation relies on the complex of historic events that shaped the
Australian character — the reliance on mates, the hardness of bush life, the
resistance to authority, and, in a few instances at least, the presence of the
"other" that shaped both the character and the humor.</p>

Penguin, 1994, 72:</p>

<p class="INDENT">A lot of new Australians live in
Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. A Chinaman had a fruit and vegie shop. Every Friday
his neighbor, a Greek bloke with a snack bar, used to pass his shop on the way
to bank his takings and he always called out, &quot;What day is it,
Chinaman?&quot;</p>

<p class="INDENT">The Chinaman always replied,
&quot;Flyday, you Gleek plick.&quot;</p>

<p class="INDENT">Not 'Flyday', you dozey bastard.
'F-r-r-r-ri-day'. Why don't you learn to talk English proper?&quot;</p>

<p class="INDENT">So, the Chinaman practised all
week. The next Friday, the Greek called out, as usual, &quot;What day is it,
Chinaman?&quot;</p>

<p class="INDENT">&quot;F-r-r-ri-day, you Gleek
plick.&quot;</p>

<p>A newer edition, published in 2000,
unaccountably changed the joke so the Greek is the grocer; while the build up
and punch line repeats, it does not have same the impact:</p>

<p class="INDENT">A Chinese guy does his shopping at
a Greek greengrocer's. The Greek keeps picking on the Chinese because he can't
pronounce the letter 'r'.</p>

<p class="INDENT">'It's Friday, you stupid prick, not
Fliday.'</p>
