 <h1>
 Overseas Chinese Cemeteries</h1>
 <p>Compiled by Terry Abraham &lt;<a href="mailto:tabraham@uidaho.edu">tabraham @
 uidaho.edu</a>&gt;
 <hr>
 <p>The overseas Chinese diaspora scattered them to the four corners of the world. In many
 cases, all that is left of their experience is a Chinese cemetery. The practice of secondary
 burial and removal meant that many former cemeteries are considered "empty." This is not a
 valid conclusion because not all bodies were removed and returned to China; in particular,
 women seldom participated in the arrangements which funded the systematic removal. Others
 were not exhumed because they failed to pay for the service. Where the context has been lost,
  the land appears available for redevelopment.
 <p>The following list includes substantial cemeteries that are well marked, small rural
 cemeteries with few or no markers, Chinese sections of community cemeteries, and areas where
 local tradition claims a Chinese cemetery.
 <p>Generally speaking, cemeteries with only a few Chinese graves are excluded.
 <p>Additions and corrections would be appreciated.
