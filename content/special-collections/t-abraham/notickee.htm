Sympathetic Representations of the Chinese in American Humor</h1>

<p style="font-size:18">

<h2>Chinese immigration and American response</h2>
<p>A combination of circumstances, some economic, some
political, and some individual, drew thousands of Chinese (mostly males) to the
American West beginning soon after the discovery of gold in California in 1848.
They were first welcomed as contributors to the labor pool, but as time passed
and economic conditions changed, white workers increasingly saw them as
economic threats with an alien lifestyle. The Irish sandlot orator Denis
Kearney and his Workingmen's Party of California campaigned on the slogan "The
Chinese Must Go" during the late 1870s. Anti-Chinese violence flared in urban
centers and rural towns; Chinese residents were attacked by mobs, beaten, and
driven out of town. At the national level, this effort culminated with the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. As a result of the law, which severely limited
Chinese immigration to the United States, the population of Chinese began to
decline from a peak of about 136,000 out of a total population of about 50 million.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In short, the early history of the Chinese was at first, and
for a brief period of time, an acceptance of their labor coupled with a
recognition of and often curiosity about their "otherness." During the second
phase, economic pressures such as business panics, unemployment, and economic
depression led to a racist and often unprovoked antipathy to the Chinese. After
exclusion, as the numbers of Chinese diminished, they either inhabited
sequestered "Chinatowns" or were incorporated into the life of the community as
restaurateurs or domestic servants.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>
In Chinatown their greater numbers usually protected them, but outside they
were often the subject of practical jokes, cruel pranks, and other activities
that sometimes became battery, robbery, or murder. The Chinese were often
targeted as the butt of humor from their earliest days on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>In early-day San Francisco, for instance, the twenty-nine
year-old Samuel Clemens would throw beer bottles on the roofs of his Chinese
neighbors to watch them run out and holler. When the Chinese went back inside,
he would toss another bottle.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>
It was the equivalent of poking a stick in an anthill to watch the ants scurry
about.</p>

<h2>Ethnic and dialect humor</h2>

<p>It is important to distinguish between ethnic and
anti-ethnic humor; a distinction not always clarified in discussions about
ethnic humor.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>
There is a difference between the stories told among themselves by members of a
group and jokes told about that group by others, often the dominant others. Racist
jokes, in particular, fall in the latter camp. It is possible, as John Lowe
notes, that "ethnic humor, so frequently used to maintain hegemony by the
group in power, can, through inversion on the part of the oppressed, become a
weapon of liberation."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>
He expands on that concept to suggest that ethnic humor is one stage in
"Americanization." This analysis, however stated, overlooks its mirror image,
the anti-ethnic joke. Making fun of the stereotypical ethnic immigrant was a
means of aggressive social control, not because it spoke directly to the ethnic
group so characterized, but because it taught a shared set of values about the
ethnic group to those who shared the joke-telling experience. </p>

<p>All ethnic groups to the United States were subject to an everyday
level of crude comedy in representation, in jokes, in stories, in art, and on
the stage. Jews, blacks, Irish, Poles, Swedes, Yankees, hillbillies; all were
(and, to a certain extent, are) on the receiving end of American humor. The
Chinese were no exception. John Fischer, in the introduction to volume of humor
reprinted from <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, notes his embarrassment over that
magazine's publication of "some of the worst humor that ever reached print.... On
the evidence of their jokes, our great-grandparents took a savage enjoyment in
the embarrassments of the poor and handicapped. Not only did they bristle with
racial and religious prejusice; they were proud of it."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p>One enormous component of ethnic humor was the dialect joke
or story. Vaudeville and burlesque, early movies, and great unreadable portions
of American "literature" were in dialect. Dialect humor was used to place a
character in a location and in an environment by shortcutting or telegraphing
the author's intentions about the character. Dialect could refer to the poor
and unlettered  the rude rustic  or to the immigrant newcomer. Fischer noted:
"It was founded on the theory that nothing in the world was quite so funny as
the mispronunciations and hamstrung syntax fo the ignorant classes  including
cowboys, waitresses, "darkies," Irishmen, farmers, and new-rich businessmen."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p>Mark Twain used a western dialect to great effect in <i>Roughing
It</i> (1872), his account of his Nevada experiences, and included several
different dialects in <i>Tom Sawyer</i> (1876) and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>
(1884)<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a>.
Finley Peter Dunne's Irish dialect stories featured the inestimable Mr. Dooley
whose trenchant political and social observations were widely read in the early
1900s and were still offered to students as a significant part of American
literature in the 1950s.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>
Amos and Andy moved from radio to early television, shifting from white actors
to black actors, capitalizing on the broad brush of stereotypes speaking a
contrived black dialect.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>
The early Marx Brothers were dialect comedians before transforming their ethnic
characters into the more unique Marx Brothers; only Chico retained his Italian
accent.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Language, in a phrase attributed to linguist Max Weinreich,
is a dialect with an army and a navy.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Dialect humor, accordingly, always results from the subordinate relationship of
the dialect speaker to the mainstream. If the story is told in dialect, you are
also being told that the dialect speaker is an "other," an immigrant, an alien,
a foreigner, a member of a lower class (although there are dialect stories that
make fun of upper class Brits), or a person of an other race. Authors of
dialect stories, now fallen from fashion, more often used dialect to write
about the Chinese than to attempt a Chinese dialect. Bret Harte, as one
example, did both.</p>

<h2>Representations of the Chinese</h2>

<p><i>Overland Monthly</i>, in September 1870, published editor
Bret Harte's "Plain language from Truthful James," an account of three
card-players, one of whom was Chinese, all of whom were cheating.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>
Upon the discovery, the Chinese was reviled with the phrase, "We are ruined by
Chinese cheap labor," and beaten. Within a year, illustrated booklets
containing the poem were being distributed under the title <i>The Heathen
Chinee</i>. It was also reprinted again and again in periodicals and
newspapers. In 1877, Harte joined with his then-friend and California
compatriot Mark Twain in converting this material into a play titled after the
Chinese character, "Ah Sin."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>
While not the first major author to present the Chinese in American literature,
Harte undoubtedly established and confirmed the pattern.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In the poem, it is August 3, 1870 in the California mining
fields. The narrator "Truthful James" (whose nickname asserts the reliability
of his tale) and Bill Nye sit down with a Chinese man to play euchre. The
Chinese man is named "Ah Sin;" "Ah" was a common honorific prefix to Chinese
forenames, it means, roughly, "That person whose name is...." The pun on sin may
have been inadvertent. Ah Sin does not understand euchre and is seen as a patsy
by James and Bill. James expresses shock at Bill's stacking the deck and
stuffing his sleeve. But his surprise is the greater when Ah Sin shows his
hand, the hand that Bill had dealt to James. </p>

<p>At this point, the Chinese dupe is revealed as a
knowledgeable and expert card sharp himself and one who has beaten the two
miners at their own game. He also had cards up his sleeves and, as well, wax
under his fingernails. Nye's verbal response echoes the refrain of the
California Workingman's Party and it is implied that an assault takes place.
The illustrated versions are more explicit in their violence, showing Ah Sin
being punched and kicked by the much larger Nye. </p>

<p>The conclusion "That for ways that are dark | And for tricks
that are vain, | The heathen Chinee is peculiar" is ironic in that it is clear
that in both "ways that are dark" and "tricks that are vain" it is not only the
Chinese who are peculiar. As Margaret Duckett noted: "the author was poking
fun not so much at the Heathen Chinee as at the race prejudice of Truthful
James."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a>
This point is essential because "the poem was accepted by the great mass of
readers as corroborating their own preconceptions in regard to the essential
sinfulness of their yellow neighbors and rivals."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p>Ah Sin, Bill Nye, and Truthful James are recurring
characters in Harte's dialect poems. In "The Latest Chinese Outrage," a group
of Chinese laundrymen seek payment for their work. Ah Sin speaks: "You owe
flowty dollee  me washee you camp." Here, again, the Chinese are treated
sympathetically, even though they are attacked for presenting their valid
grievances.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Harte specifically dates this
poem, and apparently the story it tells, to August 1870. His other poems of
this genre, so dated, range from 1856 to 1873. They purport to relate, in
western dialect, the adventures of California gold rush miners in the Sierra
Nevada. In fact, the California gold rush was pretty much over by the mid 1850s
and the "rushers" had moved on to new strikes in Colorado (1859), Idaho (1860),
Montana (1862), and, subsequently, the Black Hills (1876), and the Klondike
(1897). Those remaining tended not to be the independent prospector/miner of
the earlier days, but a paycheck miner working for a corporation. </p>

<p>Poems such as Harte's "Plain Language from Truthful James"
became part of the repertoire of amateur entertainers at home and in the
community. Before in-home entertainment technology, it was up to a person to
memorize a printed piece and declaim it on occasion. Edison's phonograph marked
the transition from live/amateur to canned/professional presentations. His
recitation of "Mary had a little lamb" marks the phonograph recording as a
device to capture the spoken word as well as what it became more well known
for, the musical piece.</p>

<p>A Chinese woman living on the remote Salmon River in central
Idaho is reported as finding humor in "Uncle Josh in a Chinese Laundry" as
played on a neighbor's wind-up phonograph about 1917.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
Yankee humorist Cal Stewart performed as Uncle Josh Weathersby, resident of the
small New England town of Pumpkin Centre. The dialect story was published in <i>Uncle
Josh's Punkin Centre Stories</i> (1903).<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>
In this story, Uncle Josh is visiting New York and inquires about laundry
services. He is directed to a nearby Chinese laundry:</p>

<p class="INDENT">So I told him
I'd like to git him to do some washin' fer me, and he commenced a talkin' some
outlandish lingo, sounded to me like cider runnin' out of a jug, somethin'
like--ung tong oowong fang kai moi oo ung we, velly good washee. Wall I understood
the last of it and jist took his word fer the rest, so I giv him my clothes and he giv me a little yeller
ticket that he painted with a brush what he had, and I'll jist bet a yoke of
steers agin the holler in a log, that no livin' mortal man could read that
ticket; it looked like a fly had fell into the ink bottle and then crawled over
the paper.</p>

<p>Not recognizing the ticket as his claim, and misdirected by
a city slicker, Josh cannot produce the ticket when he calls for his laundry.
The phrase "No tickee, no washhee" is not included. In spite of the
laundryman's protestations, Josh assaults him, and runs off with somebody
else's shirts, a part of the laundryman's queue, with the laundryman yelling
for the police behind him. Uncle Josh, as the rube, is gulled by the city
slicker (by implication) and takes out his frustration on the innocent
laundryman. I found this not much funnier with Stewart's nasal Yankee dialect
and characteristic laugh as part of the delivery.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Mieder records the earliest documented use of "No tickee, no
washee" as 1931<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a>;
which seems to be a half-century or so later than one would think. Because it
is such a central concept to Cal Stewart's dialect story, it is surprising he
did not use the phrase. Does that mean that its use did not become widespread
until after 1903 and before 1931? This would be contrary to the general
expectation that thephrase originated in the late nineteenth century, probably
in California.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p>Stage presentations were often captured, or rewritten, for
print distribution. Uncle Josh is one example. Also in this genre is the small
book entitled <i>Choice Dialect and Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i> (1902).<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a>
While it includes some jokes, such as the immigrant dialect "Mick sees Chinaman
coming up out of coal hole. 'Look at the heathen coming through the earth!
Begorry, I knew if they passed a law to keep them yellow divils out of the
country they'd get in some way,'"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>
and some that could possibly be ascribed to famous vaudevillians such as Weber
and Fields, at least one of the significant pieces about the Chinese is clearly
marked as from a literary source, <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a>
It is entitled "Isaac Rosenthal On The Chinese Question. Adapted from an
article in 'Scribner's Monthly.'" </p>

<p>Written in the mock German-Jewish dialect, Isaac Rosenthal,
"an unusually intelligent German Hebrew," recounts his experiences with the
Chinese. As a clothing merchant, he is approached by a Chinese man wanting to
purchase a coat. Isaac thinks "he vill not know a coot goat ven he zee id, and
I show him some dot ish not of the brim qualidy, and vill not last so long as
dot kind as I show you, and I sharg him a coot brice." The buyer says he'll
take it but instead of money, he offers to trade a box of tea for the coat.
Isaac accepts the trade but afterwards finds the box has an inch of good tea on
top, and below "yust rubbish, and some schmall bieces of iron to make him
heavy."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p>This dialect account of two cheaters cheating each other is
framed with text relating the story to the anti-Chinese legislation passed by
Congress in 1882: "At the time that Congress was debating upon the bill
restricting immigration from China, I was endeavoring to gather from various
sources the general opinion of the public on the question."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a>
And thus it ends with Isaac proclaiming "Und so, mein liebe Herr, you can de
reason undershtand dot I like not to have dot Shinese beobles gome to New
York."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1902, when this book was published, the Chinese
immigration question had been reopened when the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was
extended for another ten years. Two years later the ending date was removed
making the exclusion permanent, and the act was not repealed until 1943. But
the text as presented had originally appeared in <i>Scribner's</i> in February
1879. Entitled "A symposium on the Chinese Question" by A. A. Hayes, Jr.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p>Augustus Allen Hayes was the son of the well-known
Massachusetts scientist of the same name. A journalist and novelist, Hayes
apparently spent some time in China in the early 1860s, served in the
international Shanghai Volunteers, and wrote several articles based on his
experiences there. As a resident of China he had the opportunity to see the
Chinese behind the western American stereotype.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p>The symposium is framed by an introduction claiming that
while he was unable to collect "written statements from the representative
gentlemen whose views on the pressing Chinese question I have endeavored to
collate; but having first applied to a native of the Flowery Kingdom, and
learning that he 'no sa be Englishee w'litee'<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>,
I concluded to secure the services of an ex-reporter of a metropolitan journal,
and transcribe the results of his 'interviews' as follows."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> The
interviews are with Ah Lee, Alphonse de la Fontaine, Gerard Montague, the
previously mentioned Isaac Rosenthal, Phelim McFinnegan, and Eliakim Pillsbury.
Each is a masterpiece of dialect; from China, France, England, Germany,
Ireland, and Montana Territory. The westerner's conclusion is 180 degrees from
that expressed by Rosenthal: "So, pard, if my opinion's any good to you, jest
say that I calkilate to stick close to the Constitution, and if that document
don't make no difference between folks that come here from foreign parts, I say
give 'em all a show, and make 'em behave themselves, and if they don't, make
'em git up and git suddenly."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>
The author adds: "With which words of common sense (are they not so, oh,
intelligent, fair-minded reader?) cometh to an end this symposium" which leaves
one with an impression of sympathy at least towards the Chinese.</p>

<p>In a second longish comic piece in <i>Choice Dialect and
Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i>, an Irish servant, Miss Kitty Malony, describes to
her friend her experiences with the Chinese servant the "missus" added to the
household. In Irish dialect, she tells of his introduction: "there stud a rale
haythen Chineser a-grinnin' like he'd just come off a tay-box. If you'll belave
me, the crayture was that yeller it 'ud sicken you to see him; and sorra stitch
was on him but a black nightgown over his trowsers, and the front of his head
shaved claner nor a copper biler, and a black tail a-hangin' down from behind,
wid his two feet stook into the heathenests shoes you ever set eyes on."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p>She threatens to leave but is offered more money and is told
"how it was a Christian's duty to bear wid haythins and taitch em all in our
power...." Kitty agrees to put up with the new member of the household, but
complains about him spraying water on the clothes from his mouth while ironing
and of his copying her every move. The last straw occurs when Fing Wing,
mimicking her movements, steals some sugar from a delivery right in front of
the "missus" and hides it -- "with a show o' being' sly" -- in Kitty's box. Kitty
is fired on the spot; her account to her friend, however, is that "she gave me
such sass as I cuddent take from no lady, an' I give her warnin' an' left that
instant, an' she a-pointin' to the doore."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p>One again, the Chinese man is the butt of the humor, but
wins out in the end. He, even in his ignorance of custom and practice, knows
that Kitty is stealing, and demonstrates how this was done in the guise of his
imitative behavior. Her antipathy towards him, reflective of the broader
socio-politcal issues of Irish female servants being supplanted by male
Chinese, is justified when he, a fellow servant, exposes her little bit of
graft. In addition, the story both supports and contradicts the typical
expression that all servants are thieves by suggesting that only some are such.</p>

<p>That story, attributed at the end to "Mary M. Dodge," does
not have a source identified in <i>Choice Dialect and Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i>
but finding the earlier piece in <i>Scribner's</i> suggested that as a
possibility. Accordingly, the full story was found published there in January
1871, complete with illustrations.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a>
Mary M. Dodge, however, was not identified as the author on this first
publication. In fact, it was not credited to her until the release of her <i>Theophilus
and Others</i> (1876) which collected together some of her shorter pieces
including that of Miss Malony, described by a contemporary reviewer in <i>Galaxy</i>
as "the justly celebrated addition to characteristic American humor."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a>
Mary Mapes Dodge is better known as the author of <i>Hans Brinker and the
silver skates</i> (1865) and was the first and long-time editor of the
children's magazine <i>St. Nicholas</i> where she published both Mark Twain and
Bret Harte. </p>

<p>The last Chinese-related item in <i>Choice Dialect and
Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i> is a poem entitled "John Chinaman's Protest." Its
six quatrains describe the peaceful, industrious life of the Chinese immigrant,
all with the same chorus:</p>

<p class="INDENT">What fo' <br>
Melican man <br>
No wantee <br>
John Chinaman <br>
Ally mo'?<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p>"John Chinaman" was commonly used as an expression of racist
stereotyping in the nineteenth century American West to refer to the Chinese
immigrant. Here, in the pidgin dialect also considered a racist stereotype, we
find the voice of the much put-upon Chinese. Undoubtedly written by a
non-Chinese, and thus claiming to speak for him, we find "John Chinaman" asking
why? Why is he told that he is good at laundry work, an occupation imposed upon
him by the white society, but is pressured to leave. Why is he not wanted when
he minds his own business? He does not curse, he does not fight, he works hard,
and he does not beg or steal. Is it because he is not permitted to vote; "He no
go lound 'lection day, and shoutee, Fightee evelybody, smokee cigal, or dlink
beer"?<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a>
These questions are all asked in a tone of wry puzzlement. The reader
recognizes that they are good questions; the answers, of course, are harder.</p>

<p>Another example of the Chinese servant story can be found in
<i>One Thousand Laughs from Vaudeville</i> (1908). In this story, the servant,
a boy of fifteen, is asked his name. After hearing the response, the "missus"
says "Oh, that name is too long. I could never remember it, so I will call you
John." John, as we have seen, is the stereotypical name given to individual
Chinese. He asks her name, which is "Mrs. Charles Algernon McTavish Robinson"
and responds "Oh, helle! Your name is too long. I call you Charlie."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>
Here the servant turns the tables on the "missus" and pays her back in her own
kind.</p>

<h2>Humor in Racism</h2>

<p>The Chinese jokes and stories in <i>Choice Dialect and
Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i> are really only a small part of a larger whole. It may
be true that their inclusion there, particularly as modified to refer to
current events, is related to the recurrence of the national debate on Chinese
immigration. That does not address the many dialect jokes relating to Jews,
Irish, or Germans in the slim volume. Nonetheless, an effort was made to
transform material several decades old to meet modern concerns.</p>

<p>There is no editor credited with the compilation of <i>Choice
Dialect and Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i> but the publisher, Frederick J. Drake
&amp; Company, founded in 1899, was less than five years old and was
concentrating its efforts on how-to-do-it books, possibly for distribution by
one of Chicago's several mail-order houses. By 1950 the firm had moved to
nearby Wilmette.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a>
Within a few years of the turn of the century, they also published a number of
similarly themed works.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Another
explanation speaks to the likelihood that by 1902, the Chinese had moved up the
white community's apprehension scale and a backlash ensued. "'Every time a
group moves up in American culture -- blacks, women or Polish people -- there is
a corresponding intense joke cycle against them,' [historian Joseph] Boskin
explain[ed]" to a newspaper reporter.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p>If we are uncertain, then, about why <i>Choice Dialect and
Vaudeville Stage Jokes</i> includes old jokes and stories, aside from their
obvious attraction to a publisher, it is instructive to see, in the context of
the political climate of the era, how the Chinese are represented. W. P. Fenn,
in his <i>Ah Sin and his Brethren in American literature</i>, argues that the
Chinese "have served admirably as sources for humor, sensation, and exotic
background; but the have inspired little of that literature which requires for
its creation a deeper understanding of life and character."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a>
The examples here focus on the humorous and comic, but are of interest in that
they tend to be sympathetic to the Chinese unlike representation -- as dirty,
depraved, and disgusting -- in much of the popular literature.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>[47]</sup></a>
The anti-Chinese movement had a strong and multi-faceted propaganda arm, with
stories, articles, poems, plays, and illustrations.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>[48]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In the selection examined here, most of which are taken from
one slim volume of popular text, the Chinese are ultimately triumphant. Ah Sin
is the equal to the two card sharps; Mr. Rosenthal's coat buyer exchanges cheat
for cheat; Fing Wing forces Miss Malony's dismissal; although these are all
caricatures joked up to be humorous, the ostesible victim instead emerges
victorious. Unfortunately, the unfairness of the America's racial climate makes
it clear that even winning is losing. Ah Sin is beaten; the Chinese coat buyer
receives a shoddy coat, and Fing Wing -- well, maybe Fing Wing comes out ahead.</p>

<p>The Chinese servant in <i>One Thousand Laughs from
Vaudeville</i> also gets the better of the presumptuous "missus" who can not be
bothered to learn the servant's Chinese name. This story, one of several
Chinese-related jokes, is credited in the introduction to Leo Carrillo, "Teller
of Chinese Yarns" whose early vaudeville performances led him ultimately to
movies and television, most prominently as the Cisco Kid's sidekick, Pancho. In
Carrillo's autobiography, <i>The California I Love</i> (1961), he tells of
growing up next to Los Angeles' Chinatown, where the family had a Chinese
servant. He started in vaudeville telling Mexican and Chinese dialect stories
at age sixteen in while working for the art department of a San Francisco
newspaper.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>[49]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The set-up frame for the jokes is that "I will relate to you
a few Chinese stories which I picked up around Chinatown, San Francisco, while
engaged as a journalist in that city."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>[50]</sup></a>
These several stories, in spite of the inclusion of now-pejorative terms such
as "chink," "Chinaman," and "Chinese jabber" referring to language, end with
the Chinese in the superior position. In addition to the servant renaming his
"missus," he is set up to tell the Bishop to "go to helle," another servant
gets the better of a tramp at the door, and a waiter tells the customer that he
has been eating dog instead of duck; all demonstrate that these representations
of the Chinese contain multiple coded messages. Carrillo later examined his use
of dialect: "How I love the Chinese, Mexicans, Italians, and Japanese! It was
the use of their dialects in my stories which launched me on my career in vaudeville.
...In San Francisco I leaned particularly on Chinese, Mexican, and Japanese
material for California audiences. My visits to the colonies of these various
racial groups and my association with the people in their eating places, at
their work, at their places of amusement, all gave me an insight into their
national characteristics and their sense of humor. By taking these and
streamlining them into anecdotes and stories for vaudeville I conveyed the
'feel,' I think, of all these people and their outlook on life." He also noted:
"Of course I never used <sup>[dialect]</sup> for ridicule but always only as amusement, so
they could join in the laughs as well as other people. This was why I had tried
to do with all the races, for that matter, because I felt unless I entered
fully into their feelings and made them part of the act, so to speak, I might
offend. And I was determined never to hurt the feelings of anybody merely to
get a laugh out of an audience."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>[51]</sup></a>
Written a half-century later, Carrillo may have forgotten that some of his
presentations had been captured and published.</p>

<p>Unlike many others who used to dialect to characterize "the
other" Carrillo was "the other." As an hispanic in a world of "gringos," a term
Carrillo glosses as "ignoramus,"<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>[52]</sup></a>
he was an outsider. His vaudeville act drew on his own experiences with racism,
which he barely hints at in his memoir, to mock his audience's preconceptions.</p>

<p>Western historian C. L. Sonnischsen asserted "that all
humor, including western humor, is based on human failure, at least on human deviation from the norm."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>[53]</sup></a>
The Chinese clearly deviated from the norm -- as the more privileged Anglo-Saxon
defined norm -- and thus was the beneficiary of a great deal of cruel humor.
But, occasionally, the shoe was on the other foot:</p>

<p class="INDENT">The boys on the ranch decide for
New Year's resolutions that they will not tease the Chinee cook anymore, and
troop in to the kitchen to apologize to him for all the tricks they have played
on him all year. "No pull China-boy's pigtail anymore?" he asks incredulously,
"No, John, we're going to treat you right, from now on," they assure him. "No
put rattlesnake in pants?" "No more rattlesnakes, John." "No mo' dead frog in
shoe?" "No, John, we're really going to treat you right, from now on." "Velly
good. China-boy no piss in coffee anymore."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p>But why did a white audience -- to which these works were
presented -- consider any story, poem, or drama as humorous that depicted the
much-hated Chinese in a positive, even sympathetic, light? To some
commentators, the question answers itself. The funny part is in the underdog
unexpectedly being victorious. Anthropologist Elliott Oring calls this
"appropriate incongruity."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>[55]</sup></a>
The point of the joke -- maybe even all jokes -- is the fitting incongruity. In
the previous joke, appropriateness comes from the cook's revenge on his
tormentors in an action that only the cook could take; the incongruity is the
fact of his taking any action at all, particularly as he is not only the target
of the cowboys' abuse but represents all of the past century's abuse of the
Chinese immigrant.</p>

<p>And we should remember that the locus of some of these
stories might be described as mid to high American literary culture: Bret
Harte, Mark Twain, Mary M. Dodge, A. A. Hayes, <i>Harpers</i>, and <i>Scribners</i>
represented some of the most prominent and popular names, almost brand names,
as we now consider it. <i>Choice Dialect </i>and <i>One Thousand Laughs</i> are
obviously not high culture; but they trade on it by reprinting materials and
citing the brand name. These stories are far removed from the scurrilous
anti-Chinese illustrations that have been so assiduosly documented in the <i>The
Coming Man: 19th Century American Perceptions of the Chinese</i> (1994). </p>

<p>Similarly, "No tickee, no washee," speaks to the Chinese
laundryman's power over the transaction -- I won't give you your clothes if you
don't have a receipt -- while making fun of his pidgin English. As Mieder points
out, the expression has since been generalized as humorous catch-phrase
governing a wide range of transactions and not expressly related to the Chinese
at all.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p>Therefore, what is funny about these jokes and dialect
stories, in part, at least, is that they surprise the reader with the
incongruously positive view of a group of people stereotyped as the deserving
recipient of abuse. This racist notion is subverted by the underlying subtext,
mor or less explicit that the "heathen Chinee" was deserving of better
treatment. That the better treatment was not often forthcoming could be said to
be another example of the Chinaman's chance, a phrase said to have originated
in the California gold country to refer to the unfairness handed to the
Chinese: they could not win for losing.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p>But they did "win." In other twentieth-century anti- joke
cycles -- the blonde joke, the Jewish American Princess joke, the Hillary joke,
the Polack joke -- the target of the humor was the victim, not the victor.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><sup>[58]</sup></a>
Were things that much different at the end of the twentieth century than at the
beginning? Certainly the response was different. Lawsuits, boycotts, and anquished
apologies suggested a much different and less-accepting climate for the anti-
joke.<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><sup>[59]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>But the real test, observed Ellen Hopkins about women
comedians, "Power doesn't just reside in <i>not</i> being the target of a
comic's jokes. Real power is being the one who's telling them."<a style="font-size:10" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>[60]</sup></a>
The Chinese in the nineteenth and early twentiewth centuries, because of racist
immigration laws, were unable to reach that point. </p>
