A paper presented at the Joint Regional Conference Hawai'i/Pacific
and Pacific Northwest Association for Asian American Studies,
Honolulu, March 26, 1996<hr>

<p>
As she stepped off the brig <i>Eagle</i> from Hong Kong at the
San Francisco wharf in 1848, returning missionary Charles Gillespie's
servant was undoubtedly unaware of her singular position as the
first Chinese servant on the West Coast of North America.(Wegars,
Priscilla. &quot;Besides Polly Bemis: Historical and Artifactual
Evidence for Chinese Women in the West, 1848-1930,&quot; Hidden
Heritage: Historical Archaeology of the Overseas Chinese, ed.
by Priscilla Wegars. Amityville, Baywood, 1993. 230.) She would
not have realized that her presence signaled a shift in the domestic
labor market and that her sisters would not participate in the
change. Instead, the many Chinese servants who followed her were
almost entirely men, unlike the case on the East Coast where most
servants were women.(Katzman,
David M. Seven days a week: Women and Domestic Service in Industrializing
America. New York, Oxford University Press, 1978. 55.) 
<p>
Domestic service in the nineteenth century changed because of
industrialization. Previously, servants were drawn from nearby
rural areas and were often distant relatives of their employers.
Employment as a servant provided food and housing, if not a cash
income, under the paternalistic (or, as some say, maternalistic)
eye of a wealthy (or wealthier) patron. Servanthood, in the agrarian
age, was barely a step up from slavery.(Rollins, Judith. Between
Women: Domestics and their Employers. Philadelphia, Temple University
Press, 1985. 7, 203.) 
<p>
As industrialization progressed, the rising middle class and its
aspirations, coupled with a decline in the number of agricultural
workers, sparked an increase in the demand for and supply of domestic
workers. There was a consequent erection of class barriers, a
shift to working for wages, and change in the population of the
servant class. Instead of poor displaced relatives, servants came
from the class of poor displaced rural workers who were attracted
to the cities seeking increased opportunities. As the supply of
Caucasian rural expatriates declined, employers turned toward
African-Americans and immigrants. In addition, the bulk of those
becoming servants were female.(Rollins, Judith. Between Women:
Domestics and their Employers. Philadelphia, Temple University
Press, 1985. 31; Katzman, David M. Seven days a week: Women and
Domestic Service in Industrializing America. New York, Oxford
University Press, 1978. 45.) 
<p>
On the West Coast, the situation was complicated by the demographic
forces resulting from the many gold rushes. In the West, labor
was always scarce as every laborer mistakenly believed that work
in the gold fields was more remunerative than any other kind.
At the very least, the gold rushes drained off large numbers of
workers who otherwise would have been filling jobs and building
communities. There was also a resulting imbalance between the
number of males and females, with females in decidedly shorter
supply. 
<p>
The shortage of labor for such tasks as building the transcontinental
railroad meant that employers sought to import workers, either
from the eastern coast or from across the Pacific. Coupled with
outward propelling forces such as war, famine, and floods, southern
China responded to the pull of work by sending laborers to western
ports.
<p>
In accordance with Chinese custom, these immigrant laborers were
almost entirely male; the women were expected to stay at home
and sustain the husband's family. The demand for domestic labor
eventually met the supply of Chinese workers, resulting in male
Chinese laborers assuming the usually female role of domestic
servant on the West Coast of the United States and Canada, despite
efforts to recruit from traditional sources in the eastern and
southern states. By 1870, seeking replacements for the Chinese,
the San Francisco <i>Elevator</i> lamented the lack of African-American
workers on the domestic scene.(Katzman, David M. Seven days a
week: Women and Domestic Service in Industrializing America. New
York, Oxford University Press, 1978. 207.) 
<p>
Domestic service involved cooking, cleaning, waiting table, laundry,
child care, and the hundreds of other tasks that the primary caregiver
in each home provided. Many households required servants simply
because the amount of work was too much for any one person. In
addition, social mores stressed the incapacity of adult women
for domestic labor. The weak and wan dependent woman of popular
literature could not be expected to carry and boil tubs of water
to do the laundry every week. These kinds of jobs required sturdy
immigrant women who didn't have &quot;the vapors,&quot; or fainting
spells.(Katzman, David M. Seven days a week: Women and Domestic
Service in Industrializing America. New York, Oxford University
Press, 1978. 111, 120, 149.) In addition, the rich social life
of upper and middle-class women required more &quot;free&quot;
time than continual house-cleaning and cooking provided. Afternoon
social calls, teas, receptions, and dinners were part of the life-style
of the socially conscious. Florence Grohman, interviewing one
&quot;nice-looking girl,&quot; was surprised, after listing the
servant's duties, to be asked, &quot;What part of the work do
you do?&quot; Startled, she answered forthrightly, and oh-so-patronizingly,
&quot;I ha[ve] a great amount of needlework and letter writing,
and many social duties and a great deal of necessary reading to
get through. In fact, if [you] only le[ave] off being busy when
I d[o], [you will] have a hard time.&quot;(Grohman, Florence.

in, Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting grounds of western
America and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a
chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox, 1900. 358.)
Others had their doubts about this distribution of the work-load.
One observer noted: &quot;For what good purpose this assistance
sets the women free is not easy to guess; rocking the chairs seems
the most arduous duty in many Californian homes, and it is one
which is faithfully carried out.&quot;(Shepherd, William. Prairie
experiences in handling cattle and sheep. Freeport, Books for
Libraries Press, [1971 reprint] 1885. 116-117.)
<p>
Into this economic niche resulting from overwhelming demographic,
social, and political factors stepped the Chinese laborer. The
Chinese were no more suited for domestic service in the West than
were the Basque fishermen who became sheepherders there; this
was just an artificial economic niche that circumstances made
it possible for them to fill. Yet, they filled it in ways uniquely
Chinese and -- as well -- uniquely western.
<p>
It is difficult to discuss the typical Chinese servant in the
North American West in the latter half of the nineteenth century
because there is little in the way of aggregate evidence to deduce
commonalties. There is a quite a bit of anecdotal evidence but
not much in the way of quantitative summary data. (In an 1868 statistical 
report approximately 7 per cent of the Chinese immigrants in California 
were domestic servants; cited in Tsai, Shih-shan. China and the Overseas 
Chinese in the United States, 1868-1911.  Fayetteville, University of 
Arkansas Press, 1983. 21.) In addition,
it is useful to note that not all servants were always and forever
servants. Gin Chow reported that after his arrival in southern
California he first washed dishes in a French restaurant, and
then went into domestic service for six years. Following that
period he became a gardener. Eventually he bought land and became
a farmer.(Gin Chow. Gin Chow's First Annual Almanac. Los Angeles:
Wetzel Publishing, 1932. 29.) Ted Loy (Eng Moon Loy) started as
cook on a Columbia River steamboat. He stopped at Lewiston, Idaho,
at the end of the run from Portland, and joined the wealthy Vollmer
family as houseboy. Within a few years he was in the restaurant
business for good.(Yu, Li-hua. Chinese Immigrants in Idaho. PhD
dissertation, Bowling Green State University, 1991. 113.) Wing
Yee, on the other hand, began as a houseboy, then became a cook.
He remained with the same family for many years, assuming greater
responsibilities as general farm manager. He was encouraged to
bring a wife from China, who became housekeeper in his place;
and his employers built a home for his growing family next to
the main house.(Wong, H.K. Gum Sahn Yum: Gold Mountain Men. n.p.,
n.p., 1987. 125-130.)
<p>
With that in mind, let us sketch in the experiences of a &quot;typical&quot;
Chinese servant. Usually teen agers or younger when they arrived,
most knew no English and had little idea of what to expect; many
suffered extreme homesickness. Often labor contractors assigned
them to specific jobs, and both the contractor and the employer
expected them to learn on the job. If successful, they learned
to cook and clean, acquired some English, and found a good home.
The permanence of such a situation was not expected; and few were
as fortunate as Wing Yee. Any surplus funds were mailed back to
China to support the family remaining there or saved for a triumphant
return to the ancestral village. Over time, and through careful
management of their money, they moved on into other occupations
such as restaurateur or laundryman. A successful servant could
do well. Hang, cook for the Roe household in Montana, returned
to China with the immense sum of $1200 in savings.(Roe, Frances.
Army letters from an officer's wife, 1871-1888. New York, D. Appleton
&amp; Co., 1909. 311.)
<p>
The employers of servants in the West were not enthusiastic about
the choices presented to them. Catherine Hubback noted: 
<blockquote>
In this country of happy equality young women consider domestic
service a disgrace, and contrive to make it such a grievance and
mortification to their employers that were it not for China boys
I don't know what we should do. Do our own work I suppose, which
is not so bad where there are 2 or 3 women to help but comes uncomfortable
on one, who has not been used to it. But at present there is no
lack of Chinese as they come over in ship-loads.(Hubback, Catherine.
Letter, Oakland, CA, June 23, 1872. Bodleian Library, Oxford.
Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols 19-20.) 
</blockquote>

<p>
While &quot;white&quot; servants were desired, they were next
to unobtainable. Another woman wrote: &quot;When I first went
out to British Columbia with my husband, ...I do not think that
there were more than three families in Victoria, the capital,
employing white servants. These could not be obtained in the country,
but had to be imported at their employer's expense from the old
country. The white girls thus brought over seldom stayed in their
places long, as they quickly married, or left to obtain higher
wages.&quot;(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White Agony:
a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and
life in the hunting grounds of western America and British Columbia.
by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman.
London: Horace Cox, 1900. 333.) Those who were fortunate enough
to hire &quot;white&quot; labor displayed no little pride in their
fortune. &quot;If my girl [Bridget] were not the best natured
in the world, she would be put out sometimes; but fortunately
she never is under any circumstances. She is a treasure and worth
her thirty-five dollars a month in this part of the world. Our
neighbors have Chinamen and pay them thirty dollars. I would rather
give five dollars more and have a good reliable woman, although
the Chinamen make excellent servants, good cooks, and excellent
washermen and ironers.&quot;(Allen, Mary Julia. Letter, March
15, 1868, [Camp Steele], San Juan Island, to Sister Carrie. Photocopy
(of a typescript copy) in the Asian American Comparative Collection,
Laboratory of Anthropology, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.)
Employers saw the &quot;ship loads&quot; of Chinese as a specific
solution to a specific problem. 
<p>
Later, it was conveniently overlooked that, as one commentator
noted, &quot;...the cry against the Chinamen, because in family
service they are underbidding white labor[,] can not be considered
worthy of much attention, when it is known that there has never
been a time in California when a wholesome, capable white person,
willing to do house-work, could not readily find employment at
better wages than they could command in the Eastern States for
the same labor.&quot;(Gibson, Otis. The Chinese in America. Cincinnati,
Hitchcock &amp; Walden, 1877. 107.) 
<p>
While domestic wages were higher in the West than in the East,
the Chinese were able to compete almost entirely on price at first,
not quality.(Wages in California in 1899 were estimated at $4.57
a week, Katzman, David M. Seven days a week: Women and Domestic
Service in Industrializing America. New York, Oxford University
Press, 1978. 307; $30 a month was the rate on San Juan Island,

Vernon, Di. &quot;The Chinese as house servants.&quot; Good Housekeeping,
12(January 1891)20.) As one employer noted, &quot;It is scarcely
fair to compare poor John with the trim English maid in her cap
and apron, who has been well trained in modern civilities as well
as her duties, nor can his culinary productions compare with those
of a finished European cook; but with the average plain cook and
the inefficient housemaid the contrast would be all in his favour.&quot;(Grohman,
Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White Agony: a chapter on Western
Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting

; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox,

<p>
Over time, and through on-the-job training, the Chinese developed
a reputation for quality service worth paying for. An unusual
letter from a &quot;white&quot; domestic, printed in the newspaper,
underscores her perception of the economic disadvantage. 
<blockquote>
What are the chances for getting employment in your city? The
Chinese barbarians have captured Boise and will soon rule the
whites. I would like to know if this is a free and independent
country? If so, why should the Chinamen carry on their bull-dosing
[sic] operations? I went to Boise city to try and get employment
but the answer at each house was, &quot;We've got a Chinaman.&quot;
I inquired the amount of wages paid. The answer usually was $8
a week. I asked several of them what they would give a good cook
and house keeper if they could get a white woman. The reply was
about $4 a week. I left them disgusted, and subsequently met a
friend, Mrs. ---. She wanted a girl if she could get one, having
just discharged her Chinaman. I asked what she would pay a good
cook. She said $3 per week; she said she had given her Chinaman
$7, but he was much better than a white woman. I bade her good
day, with a tear in my eye, wishing I was a Chinaman.(Idaho Avalanche
(Silver City), March 31, 1877, as quoted in Yu, Li-hua. Chinese
Immigrants in Idaho. PhD dissertation, Bowling Green State University,
1991. 130.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Filling a vacant position was relatively easy. Grace Pfafflin
noted that in Lewiston, Idaho, they recruited their Chinese help
from local merchant &quot;Quang Sing's voluntary employment bureau.&quot;(Pfafflin,
Grace. Pioneer Chinamen of Idaho. Seeing Idaho, 1:9(February 1938)
23. In one case, the employer placed a newspaper advertisement
endorsing cook for a new position. Lewiston Northerner, 1:31(May
22, 1875)3, as quoted in Wegars, P. Chinese at the Confluence
(unpublished manuscript).) Many cities had employment agencies,
often run by entrepreneurial Chinese, that brokered opportunities
and vacancies.(&quot;Idaho Recorder on April 18 of 1894, further
noted that a Chinese company called Fong Kee &amp; Co. had opened
an employment agency for Chinese cooks and laborers. [p.2,c.3],&quot;
as quoted in Yu, Li-hua. Chinese Immigrants in Idaho. PhD dissertation,
Bowling Green State University, 1991. 130.) Selecting from the
applicants was not without its perils. 
<blockquote>
As for engaging a boy, it would take too long to tell of all the
little tricks practiced, the frauds perpetuated, the knaveries
committed by the &quot;officeman&quot; and the boys he sends out
to engage as servants. Some of them promise to come to work at
a certain time, and then never appear, while the hapless housekeeper
sits waiting at home for the boy that is not to come. They ask
to see the kitchen, they put all the regulation questions as to
the number in the family, the time for meals, the size of the
wash, generally winding up with, &quot;no make beds.&quot; If
there is one thing above another that a Celestial seems to hate,
it is to make a bed. The Chinese will take a place, representing
themselves as finished cooks, and when the first attempt at a
meal shows their ignorance of how to boil potatoes, or to light
a fire, with a bland smile, John will say, &quot;You teachee me
then I sabe.&quot;(Vernon, Di. &quot;The Chinese as house servants.&quot;
Good Housekeeping, 12(January 1891)22.) 
</blockquote>

<p>
Mrs. Hubback acquired her cook through Samki, an employment agent.
At one point, hearing strange voices in the kitchen, she found
her cook and another Chinese who said: 
<blockquote>
[H]e &quot;had come from Samki, you savez Samki, he say that man
go back to Samki -- he no learn cook -- I come here, I learn cook,
my broder he go to city, he go to Samki.&quot; Meanwhile Moon's
face assumed a [frowning] look... &amp; he said not a word. After
a great deal of palaver &amp; gibberish the other man was ejected,
&amp; Moon went &amp; locked the door &amp; then poured out a
torrent of <u>pidgeon English</u> quite unintelligible. However
when he had calmed a little, I made out that Samkee wants him
to make cigar boxes -- &quot;I no like make boxes -- I likee learn
cook I no go&quot; and he wants to stay here, but appears to be
a good deal afraid tha[t] Samkee and an unknown but overwhelming
force of Chinamen will come when I am out, &amp; carry him away.
If they come when I am at home, I am to say to them &quot;Go [a]long,
get out, get out, <u>dam smart</u>.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine.
Letter, Oakland, CA, February 9, 1873. Bodleian Library, Oxford.
Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols 42-43.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Another woman advised that it was not necessary to &quot;go to
an intelligence office. Rather, you ask an interview with the
best specimen of the sort you have seen in the houses of friends.
There is a good chance that he will bring to you shortly after
a man, the exact counterpart of himself, who he will call his
'cousin.'&quot;(Faison, Jean. &quot;The virtues of the Chinese
servant.&quot; Good Housekeeping, 17(May 1896)279.) &quot;Cousin&quot; was shorthand for a clan relationship. (Tsai, Shih-shan 
Henry. The Chinese Experience in america. Bloomington, Indiana University 
Press, 1986. 46)
 
<p>
 Lack of language ability hindered both sides of the relationship.
The employer was not expected to learn Chinese and the Chinese
were expected to learn English by osmosis. &quot;The only boy
I could get is a man, Moon, he calls himself, who has a silk tassel
in his hair, &amp; he not only knows very little cooking, but
still less English. It is not easy to get on with no language
in common, so as you say -- it is a trial -- I took him on trial,
&amp; I find him such.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine. Letter, Oakland,
CA, February 9, 1873. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols
42-43.) Mrs. Hubback fired another servant for his lack of skill,
&quot;He knows so little English that I could not make him understand
an abstract idea, he thought I was angry with him, &amp; said
pathetically 'Me go, you no likey Wan.' with his hand on his heart,
&amp; his diagonal eyes blinking narrowly.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine.
Letter, Oakland, CA, April 27 1873. Bodleian Library, Oxford.
Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols 44-45.) 
<p>Then as now, immigrant workers
sought help learning the dominant language. Missionaries were
eager to teach English as a way of spreading the gospel. Employers
also mistakenly believed that Christian teachings would make the
Chinese better servants. The Chinese responded in their own fashion.
<blockquote>
All the Evangelical churches threw open their assembly rooms,
offering to teach the heathen to read, in hopes that they might
learn the A B C of the gospel. Nor were the heathen unwilling,
and discriminating fellows that they were, crowded around the
bright young girls whose zeal in the Master's service had led
them to this path of duty. But ancient spinsters were rejected,
with that lack of gallantry characteristic of Oriental nations.
&quot;Me no likee old one,&quot; was what each seeker after knowledge
said. After a time, however, slowly but surely, it began to dawn
upon the minds of some of these good people that the wily Chinese
had simply used their Christian endeavors as a free day school
and an intelligence office.(Vernon, Di. &quot;The Chinese as house
servants.&quot; Good Housekeeping, 12(January 1891)21.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Note how the otherwise laudable effort to learn the dominant language
and become socialized in the dominant culture is ridiculed and
demeaned. Newspaper articles complained that the only result of
such education was that the pupil would just quit and go &quot;elsewhere
for higher wages.&quot;(&quot;Chinese Domestic Servants,&quot;
Idaho Signal (Lewiston), 1:49(February 8, 1873)1, reprinted from
the &quot;S.F. Chronicle.&quot;) Mrs. Grohman found herself acting
as teacher to her servant; in exchange for security she gave him
lessons. &quot;...I disliked being alone in the house during the
long November evenings. Although I had many kind friends who took
pity on my loneliness, very often I felt it would be more canny
if Gee could be induced to stay in the house till nine or ten
o'clock. He did not seem to like the idea at all when I suggested
it, and nothing more was said about it for a few days. Then he
came with a proposal; 'Missus Gloman, I velly solly you all alone
evening. I stay till half-past nine or ten, but I like you teach
me lead and write English; I get book. After work I come in? You
tink so?'&quot;(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White
Agony: a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years'
sport and life in the hunting grounds of western America and British
Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman.
London: Horace Cox, 1900. 336-337.)
<p>
Learning English was one thing, learning to cook was another.
Although some Chinese were reportedly trained in hotel kitchens
before being sent to families in the hinterlands, most learned
on the job.(Pfafflin, Grace. Pioneer Chinamen of Idaho. Seeing
Idaho, 1:9(February 1938) 23.) It was part of the price one paid
to have inexpensive help. Catherine Hubback noted: &quot;When
I was your age I had little idea I should ever be teaching cooking
to a China man in California.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine. Letter,
Oakland, CA, February 9, 1873. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols
42-43.) Later, she added, &quot;And I would much rather teach
a China boy than an English girl even or Irish girl certainly.
One never gets impertinence in words, &amp; even if they are angry
they only slam the door. They cannot speak well enough to be saucy.&quot;(Hubback,
Catherine. Letter, Oakland, CA, April 27, 1873. Bodleian Library,
Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols 44-45.) Florence Grohman was forced
to hire the cheapest of Chinese servants once, cheap by reason
of inexperience. 
<blockquote>
One winter when I was in Victoria there was an unusual scarcity
of Chinese servants, and I tried in vain to procure a suitable
white girl. I at last engaged a small six-dollar boy. He could
say &quot;Yes,&quot; and &quot;Boot,&quot; and &quot;Knife.&quot;
He knew absolutely nothing. When one has to train a boy like this,
one recognises what it is not to have an European groundwork to
begin on. The most elementary things must be taught from the beginning.
He could not light a fire, he had never used a scrubbing brush,
and he had not yet realised that empty saucepans left on a red-hot
stove will burn, and that tin ones invariably melt. But once shown
how to do anything, the boy, whom we called Charlie, not having
been able to understand his real name, never forgot how to do
it.(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White Agony: a chapter
on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and life in
the hunting grounds of western America and British Columbia. by
W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman.
London: Horace Cox, 1900. 349.) 
</blockquote>

<p>
Although quick to learn, the Chinese servant was often sufficiently
uncomfortable with all the strange tasks he was called upon to
perform that he learned not to venture too much initiative. The
servant who tossed his master's prize limburger cheese into the
river thinking it spoiled is but one example of the dangers of
making assumptions in a different culture.(Pfafflin, Grace. Pioneer
Chinamen of Idaho. Seeing Idaho, 1:9(February 1938)23.) Florence
Grohman sympathetically noted of her Chinese servant, &quot;It
is marvellous how he adapts himself so well to the many strange
duties required of him.&quot;(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow
and White Agony: a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen
years' sport and life in the hunting grounds of western America
and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a chapter
by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox, 1900. 333.) Several
women repeated tales of the hazards of rote learning. Mrs. Grohman
reports one as a classic, probably apocryphal, story and adds
her own account:
<blockquote>
The mistress of this Chinaman is said to have shown her man how
to make a cake; taking six eggs for this, she broke them one by
one, in the orthodox manner, into a cup, and then pouring each
into a basin. The third she came to was bad, so she threw it away,
the like fate befell number four, and two more were taken to replace
them. Next time the Chinaman was told to make a cake, he also
took six eggs, the third and the fourth he threw away, although
they were perfectly fresh, and he replaced them, as the mistress
had done, from the egg basket from the store-room. Charlie's act
was similar. One day I undertook to show him how to bake, and
I had got as far as ten minutes' kneading of the dough out of
the thirty required, when I suddenly remembered that my last bread
had not been successful, because the oven had not heated properly.
As this was probably owing to the stove pipe being full of soot,
I determined to have it remedied at once, and, covering up the
dough, I made the boy take down the stove pipe, clear out all
the soot, and clean up the stove again, before proceeding with
the bread making. When his turn came to make the bread, I went
into the kitchen to watch him and see that all went well; everything
was imitated exactly, when he suddenly stopped kneading, and said:
&quot;Ten minutes now,&quot; and, covering up the dough, disappeared
to fetch bucket and broom for the cleaning of the stove pipe,
which, of course, did not want doing again.(Grohman, Florence.

The daughter of a mine superintendent in Park City, Utah, remembered:
&quot;Very, very early in my life we had Chinese servants in the
home, and the first one had to be taught by Mother exactly how
to cook each dish according to the taste of the family, and exactly
how to do each act of housekeeping. The secret was to lay an accurate
foundation psychologically, and then there would be no trouble.
If John left, he would teach accurately his 'cousin' Tom, and
when Tom left, he would introduce his 'cousin' Charlie to the
mysteries. It was a sort of apostolic succession. And if one taught
the first major domo and factotum but one little error by mistake,
that little error traveled on <i>ad infinitum</i> as long as there
were 'cousins' in succession in one's cuisine and menage.&quot;(M.,
D. M &quot;Picturesque America,&quot; The Pacific, (November 1934)
135.)
<p>
Another explanation given is that the Chinese servant is unable
&quot;to unlearn. He learns with alacrity to cook new things or
to cook old ones in new ways, but more he cannot do. If you find
on second thought, for instance, that his recipe for mayonnaise
calls for too much mustard you must learn to like some other dressing,
for your cook, try as he may, cannot amend what is graven in his
memory.&quot;(Faison, Jean. &quot;The virtues of the Chinese servant.&quot;
Good Housekeeping, 17(May 1896)280.)
<p>
Mrs. Hubback wrote of one, named On, that he &quot;cooks very
well, &amp; boils mutton much better than Bohea did, because he
knows it should not boil fast.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine. Letter,
Oakland, CA, September 23, 1872?. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fol
29.) She also praised his breakfasts: &quot;hot rolls, beefsteak,
tomatoes, corn &amp; an omelette. I only ordered the steak &amp;
tomato sauce, the rest was voluntary with him.&quot;(Hubback,
Catherine. Letter, Oakland, CA, September 23, 1872?. Bodleian
Library, Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fol 29.) Florence Grohman complimented
her cook: &quot;He could cook fairly well, he could roast and
boil, and make clear soup, good pastry, and mayonnaise sauce;
everything devoid, however, of pepper and salt, as he carefully
explained to me, 'That no matter, I put him on the table.' (<i>Him</i>
meaning pepper and salt.)&quot;(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow

Not all Chinese servants were content with the new roles thrust
upon them. In Lewiston, Idaho, as a young girl, Grace Pfafflin
remembered their new cook plaintively wailing &quot;Me wantee
go back San Flan-cis-co.&quot;(Pfafflin, Grace. Pioneer Chinamen
of Idaho. Seeing Idaho, 1:9(February 1938) 23.) Florence Grohman
recounts the story of a very young, very shy, servant: &quot;Just
before luncheon was to be announced, I became aware of a scuffle
going on outside the door, and remonstrances being exchanged between
the widow and the boy. 'Me no likey, me no likey,' he exclaimed,
as the door opened suddenly and Sing was shoved into the room,
the widow prompting him from behind. He spread out his hands,
made an awkward bow, saying, 'Dinner he ready,' and then, ducking
his head, turned tail and escaped out of the room from the widow's
clutches. 'I am trying to teach him manners, but he has no <i>savey</i>,'
explained the widow.&quot;(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow
and White Agony: a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen
years' sport and life in the hunting grounds of western America
and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a chapter
by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox, 1900. 334.) Later,
he left the widow's employ because the daughter, collapsed on
the floor in Victorian-era fainting spell, seemed to him afflicted
by the devil. &quot;No persuasion, not even extra dollars, would
alter his decision, and for some days no Chinaman nor any other
help could be procured,&quot; which meant that, with the widow
ill as well, the lodger assumed all the household chores until
a &quot;white&quot; woman servant was found.(Grohman, Florence.

<p>
Another young man was also quite shy; too shy, she noted, &quot;to
become a satisfactory parlourmaid. At first he would deposit all
the dishes that he brought from the kitchen on the hall table,
announce their being there by a loud knock on the dining-room
door, and before one could open it he had taken refuge in the
kitchen. It was some time before he would remove the plates and
wait at table, and if one had a guest of whom he felt in awe,
he would return to his original methods, or, at best, put the
whole trayful of things on the sideboard, and make his exit rapidly,
not heeding any remonstrances from me or the boss.&quot;(Grohman,
Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White Agony: a chapter on Western
Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting
grounds of western America and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman
; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox,
1900. 350.) &quot;The boss&quot; is the husband of the household.
<p>
On renting a house and assuming the previous Chinese servant,
Mrs. Grohman found that he had set ideas about which chores were
whose. &quot;One day I found a broom and a dust-pan left in the
drawing-room. On telling him to remove it, he said: 'O, I tink
you sweep out dlawing-loom to-day, velly good.' I retorted that
I thought it would be better if he swept it out. 'No, no, I no
do that loom; missus she do him evely week; I no time.' He really
seemed to be doing the work of three English servants, as he was
laundress, as well as cook and housemaid; so I resolved to follow
in his former mistress's footsteps.&quot;(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The
Yellow and White Agony: a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in,
Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting grounds of western
America and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a
chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox, 1900. 335.)
She undoubtedly showed more good humor about the situation than
some other mistresses. As it was, she was not able to meet his
standards:
<blockquote>
I had vivid recollections of the housemaid's &quot;doing&quot;
rooms at home, and of seeing all the furniture turned topsy-turvy
into the passage, and tea-leaves being sprinkled over everything,
and I was soon at work in a business-like fashion, with my dress
pinned up and my apron on, when up came Gee with a clean duster.
&quot;Velly good, you tie him over your head, missus did.&quot;
Accepting the suggestion, I then began to move the furniture,
and sweep. Presently the door opened a little, Gee's head was
inserted in the crack, and he watched me in silence as I continued
to raise as much dust as possible, and pretended not to notice
him. Then, after a few seconds, he exclaimed: &quot;Missis Gloman,
you go out walk, I tink.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;No time, Gee; what do you want?&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;I sweep this loom, you no can do him; my missus, she velly
strong, she <i>savey</i>.&quot; Then with scorn he added: &quot;You
no know how, you give me bloom, you go to lunch with Missus Dlake.&quot;
Then following his head into the room, he seized the broom, tied
on the apron, and put the duster, which I had just relinquished,
on to his head, and, thankful for the release, I acted on the
suggestion, and went out to lunch with my friends.(Grohman, Florence.

<p>
Frances Roe noted that with her new servant, after two years in
his last position, &quot;it was some time before I could convince
him that this house was regulated my way and not hers.&quot;(Roe,
Frances. Army letters from an officer's wife, 1871-1888. New York,
D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1909. 290.) It was not a question of doing
it his way at all.
<p>
Not all servants acceded to such changes gracefully. Quitting
was always available as a means of expressing displeasure. Captain
Conrad's wife lost her servant when she tried to tell him how
to do laundry.(Roe, Frances. Army letters from an officer's wife,
1871-1888. New York, D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1909. 184; see also
231-232.)
<p>
The Chinese servants' lack of &quot;<i>savey</i>&quot; regarding
Victorian manners was well known and adjusted to:
<blockquote>
One gets accustomed to the funny way in which they invariably
open a house door, only by an inch or two, when one calls, and
stick out their heads and ask who you want and who you are. If
they are uncertain as to whether their mistress is at home or
not, they as often as not shut the door in one's face, leaving
one on the doorstep while they go and inquire. I tried to correct
this in Gee, but the result was not much better, he would throw
the door wide open, and stand in the hall and shout for me to
know if I were at home, and if I would see Mrs. So-and-so. Sometimes
when their mistresses are out they don't think it worth while
to answer the door at all, in which case one shoves one's cards
under the crack of the door, lodges them on the handle, or puts
them under the doormat. On Sunday afternoon every household is
emptied of its Chinamen, for they all expect half a day off, and,
leaving as soon as the mid-day meal is cleared away, often refuse
to come back and get the supper, and do not appear again until
Monday morning. Visitors on a Sunday afternoon expect the ladies
of the house to prepare afternoon tea and supper, and to answer
the door. As long as everyone understands this arrangement it
is all right, but when strangers from the East or the Old Country
arrive, such ways of roughing it in an otherwise civilised town,
is [sic] apt to astonish them.(Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow
and White Agony: a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen
years' sport and life in the hunting grounds of western America

<p>
If life with Chinese servants, or any servants, for that matter,
was considered to be an adventure, it was clearly preferable to
life without them. Mrs. Grohman's experience cleaning the drawing
room is but one example. When her landlady was ill with bronchitis,
Mrs. Grohman felt she had 
<blockquote>
no alternative but to initiate myself into the mysteries of cooking,
making poultices, and brewing beef-tea, in fact, the duties of
a general servant, <i>plus</i> those of a nurse. It was really
a most exciting time, the anxiety with which one watched the boiling
and the baking, the triumph one felt when any dish was absolutely
cooked and served up, looking at all like the work of a professional
cook; the delight when the fire did burn without any trouble,
and the pride when the beef-tea was pronounced &quot;the very
thing&quot; by the invalid, are all beyond description.(Grohman,
Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White Agony: a chapter on Western
Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting
grounds of western America and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman

1900. 335.) 
</blockquote>

<p>
And when the camp cook quit unexpectedly while out in the wilds
of central British Columbia, she stepped in to fill the gap. 
<blockquote>
So I did the cooking -- quite easy in an ordinary house-hold but
a great deal of ingenuity was required to make a variation in
the meals. There was no store except our own, and one on the CPR
but this was certainly not less than 100 miles away. I had to
bake bread in a very tiny oven, so it had to be done three times
a day for the very hungry people who came to eat.... There was
breakfast at 7 -- and a hearty breakfast it was, too! -- to be
got ready; at 4 they rush in for tea, and at 7, supper. I did
not mind a bit doing the cooking, but as it was sometimes 80 degrees
or 90 degrees in the shade, I got rather tired by the end of the
day. ...During this rather harassing time between Chinamen, when
I had a heavy day's cooking, to refresh ourselves Clare Drake
and I would ride over to the lake and bathe, returning in time
to make tea.(Grohman, Florence. &quot;Story told of early days
at Canal Flat.&quot; Lake Windermere Valley Echo, August 8, 1968.

<p>
During Chinese New Year festivities, the servants asked for and
received time off. Since this, of course, was not when the Euroamericans
celebrated New Year's, the lunar festivity was unlikely to be
noted on their calendars, so it probably always took them by surprise.
And at such times, the work load remained. &quot;I was glad when
the Chinese celebration of New Year was over. Jeek came back punctually
on Tuesday evening, but it is hard work cleaning and bedmaking,
altho' the worst of all is dishwashing. I don't know how one can
help putting one's hands in greasy water, &amp; mine have been
rough &amp; uncomfortable ever since. Yes we all agree dishwashing
is the worst part of our boys going away -- but as the grocer's
clerk said -- he found many ladies in the kitchen on those two
mornings.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine. Letter, Oakland, CA, February
22, 1874. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fols 56-57.)
<p>
While much of the late Victorian era social life existed only
in the magazines and other taste-arbiters (how much attention
do we pay to <i>Vogue</i> or even <i>Harper's</i>, today), it
did seem that every home must have its Chinese servant. Not just
in the provincial capitals such as Victoria, where Mrs. Grohman
entertained in the grand manner, but even in remote mining towns
in Idaho, and inland communities such as Boise, Walla Walla, and
Lewiston. In mountainous Pierce, Idaho, for instance, in 1880,
there were seven household cooks and three Chinese servants.(Stapp,
Darby C. &quot;The Documentary Record of an overseas Chinese Mining
Camp.&quot; Hidden Heritage: Historical Archaeology of the Overseas
Chinese, ed. by Priscilla Wegars. Amityville, Baywood, 1993. 15.)
One woman remembered of Boise, &quot;nearly everyone whom I knew
had a Chinese cook, and usually he was not only the cook but generally
house boy -- washing, ironing, and doing all of the heavy work.
For those who could not afford Chinese help there were always
squaws who were glad to do the washing and hard work.&quot;(&quot;Boise
in the Seventies was a Delightful, Gay City,&quot; Idaho Statesman,
23 July 1939, p. 6, as quoted in Yu, Li-hua. Chinese Immigrants
in Idaho. PhD dissertation, Bowling Green State University, 1991.
128-129.) Another noted: &quot;All the first families had them,
and so did the young officers stationed at Boise Barracks.&quot;(&quot;Dragon
is Gone,&quot; undated Statesman clipping in ISHS vert. file,
as quoted in Yu, Li-hua. Chinese Immigrants in Idaho. PhD dissertation,
Bowling Green State University, 1991. 129.) It was not uncommon
for military officers to have Chinese servants in the western
posts, nor was it unknown for U.S. Navy vessels to have Chinese
and Japanese servants.(Photographs of General O.O. Howard's Chinese
servants, as presented by Donna Wells of Howard University, SAA
annual meeting, Washington, DC, September 1995; Roe, Frances.
Army letters from an officer's wife, 1871-1888. New York, D. Appleton
&amp; Co., 1909; &quot;Admiral Dewey did not hesitate, in his
official report, to highly praise the Chinese servants employed
on his ship.&quot; Lewiston Teller, 22(52):2, 16 September 1898.)
In Walla Walla, in eastern Washington, &quot;In those days anyone
who aspired to be classed as one of the Nob Hill set simply had
to have a Chinese cook.&quot;(Bennett, Robert. Walla Walla a town
built to be a city:1900-1910. v. 2 (np. 1982) 159; as quoted by
Jewell, James Robinson. &quot;Straw hat work force: The Chinese
role in small town economies.&quot; Pacific Northwest Forum, Second
Series, 6:1(Winter-Spring 1993) 47.) As James Robinson Jewell
noted, &quot;The resentment demonstrated against the Chinese domestics
was in part a bitterness towards the lifestyle it took to employ
them.&quot;(Jewell, James Robinson. &quot;Straw hat work force:

<p>
Anti-Chinese agitation, common throughout the West, made a complicated
mistress-servant relationship even more difficult. In places where
the Chinese were totally excluded, such as Wallace, Idaho, the
families of means were forced to do without Chinese servants.(Wegars,
Priscilla. &quot;Entrepreneurs and `Wage Slaves': Their Relationship
to Anti-Chinese Racism in Northern Idaho's Mining Labor Market,
1880-1910,&quot; in Racism and the Labour Market: Historical Studies,
edited by Marcel van der Linden and Jan Lucassen. Peter Lang:
Bern, 1995. 471-472.) In California, Catherine Hubback reported
to her son in England:
<blockquote>
I do not know what the persecution of the Chinese will end in.
They have passed a decree to shave all their heads if committed
to prison, and they are constantly committing them for all sorts
of things which they don't notice in any other people. Then they
lay heavy taxes on their laundries, they tried it 2 years ago,
and the Chinese beat them in a suit at law. Now, they say they
can't  afford to go to law again, but shall wait till the proper
representations are made by the Chinese authorities. They being
quite aware that the tax is an infringement of their rights secured
by treaties. Of course there is danger that the injustice here
will be retaliated on Americans in China -- and I suppose the
other states would not like to give up the Chinese trade, however
the Californians  may resolve to drive them out of the country.(Hubback,
Catherine. Letter, Oakland, CA, May 21, 1876. Bodleian Library,
Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fol 89-90.)
</blockquote>

<p>
She anticipated trouble on the upcoming Fourth of July remembering
an alarming incident in England. Both events were assigned to
the Irish: 
<blockquote>
Do you remember the regiment of Irish dragoons -- no volunteers,
who wanted to pillage Bradford &amp; put loaded cartridges in
their rifles at a review, and then did set fire to the barracks
at Portsmouth &amp; plunder the officer's quarters. My fear is
that the Irish  here may do something of the sort against the
Chinese. It would be a fine chance during the processions and
tom-fooleries on the 4th when all the fire brigade will be out
in the procession, and of course, out of the way of a fire in
the Chinese quarter. A fire when everything is dry and the wind
blowing as it always does in July, would be something serious.(Hubback,
Catherine. Letter, Oakland, CA, May 21, 1876. Bodleian Library,
Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fol 91.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Florence Grohman had a more personal experience in Victoria. Her
servant, Gee, was personally threatened. She contacted the police
and lodged a complaint but received little assistance. Personal
action was necessary, and then Gee took steps himself.
<blockquote>
The way some of the white &quot;Hoodlums&quot; of the town behaved
to the Chinamen was disgraceful. They frightened my man so much,
that, for some time he scarcely liked to go outside the gate to
pass a large vacant place close to us which the boys of the town
had made a playground of. One day they knocked him off the sidewalk,
and at the same time cut his head so badly with a stone that he
rushed home to me, and I had to plaster and bandage his head and
eye. I telephoned at once to the police station. The conversation
I had was somewhat characteristic of the happy-go-lucky colonial
way of doing things.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;The boys on the green opposite my house attacked my Chinaman,
who was going into town; they have knocked him about very badly.
As they are still playing on the green the man is afraid to go
out. Send a policeman up.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;Well, take the names of the boys and send them to us.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;I can't go out and catch them, that is your business.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;See if there ain't a policeman on Douglas-street, and put
him on to them.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;I can't see one [on] my end of Douglas-street; what is the
man to do?&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;Well, I guess, if he is scared he best stop at home; or
you could walk down the street with him a bit, they won't go for
him if you are there; we are too busy to look after every Chinaman
that has a stone thrown at him.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Cool, but as there seemed that no more help was forthcoming, I
did accompany Gee past the dangerous playground.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;I got something for boys now, when he come and throw stones
at me,&quot; chuckled Gee, a day or two after this, and with this
he produced from his wide sleeve a large iron crowbar. &quot;I
tuck him up my sleeve,&quot; he said; &quot;boy come, I just knock
him hard on head.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;Give it to me, Gee; where did you get it.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;I go hardware (ironmonger) store; man there he know me,
he ask me what the matter with my head, I tell him all about boy,
then he give me bar, he tell me that settle boy pletty soon.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;Yes, Gee, and that will settle you, too; for if it killed
the boy you would be hanged.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I kept the bar, and returned it to the man at the hardware stores
[sic], whose only excuse for having supplied him gratis with such
a murderous weapon, was -- well, they all carry them.(Grohman,

Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting

</blockquote>

<p>
The language used to refer to the Chinese servants in contemporary
newspaper accounts, magazines, books, even private letters, was,
as was common at the time, emotionally charged and negative in
tone. Frequent terms were &quot;Chinaboy,&quot; &quot;John,&quot;
&quot;Chinaman,&quot; &quot;Celestials.&quot;(These terms were
all used in Vernon, Di. &quot;The Chinese as house servants.&quot;
Good Housekeeping,  12(January 1891)20-22.) While these terms
are rightly avoided today, because of the connotations which have
accreted to them over the years, they do not necessarily reflect
the whole of the relationship. Some, in spite of using the same
racist terminology at times, defended them from such stereotyping.
Mrs. Hubback wrote back to England that, &quot;My school boys
today, who last week told me 'their neighbor' meant one who lived
 next door, today remembered that it meant every one, except Chinese
-- 'they being heathens,' and 'coming here and taking the work
from white men' -- You may guess I gave them a sharp lecture,
holding up the Chinese for filial duty &amp;c &amp;c -- and saying
it was no wonder when Christian children set such bad examples
that they continued heathen still.&quot;(Hubback, Catherine. Letter,
Oakland, CA, July 14, 1872. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Ms.Eng.lett.e.150.fol
22-23.) It is thus difficult to measure racist attitudes by a
contemporary speaker's choice of terms. Even one writer, who widely
and commonly used such terms in a single article about Chinese
servants, could conclude &quot;yet, as has so often been said,
in many respects they are the best servants that we ever have
had.&quot;(Vernon, Di. &quot;The Chinese as house servants.&quot;
Good Housekeeping,  12(January 1891)22.)
<p>
In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the &quot;Servant
Problem&quot; took up a great deal of the popular press' ink.(Katzman,
David M. Seven days a week: Women and Domestic Service in Industrializing
America. New York, Oxford University Press, 1978. 223-265.) In
the West, in particular, the availability of Chinese men as domestic
servants put a unique twist on that query. Some reported having
nothing but problems with their Chinese servants. They were &quot;the
most filthy, mendacious, thieving, unreliable class of house-servants
in all the world.&quot;(Gibson, Otis. The Chinese in America.
Cincinnati, Hitchcock &amp; Walden, 1877. 103) Others found the
Chinese servants to be no more nor less unsatisfactory than any
other ethnic, racial, or economic group.(Gibson, Otis. The Chinese
in America. Cincinnati, Hitchcock &amp; Walden, 1877. 103; Grohman,
Florence. &quot;The Yellow and White Agony: a chapter on Western
Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years' sport and life in the hunting
grounds of western America and British Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman
; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman. London: Horace Cox,
1900. 333, 353.) Yet others were sure that the Chinese men were
&quot;the best.&quot; (Seldom mentioned in this context are the Confucian 
virtues demonstrated by Chinese servants. See, for 
instance, Tsai, Shih-shan Henry. The Chinese Experience in America. 
Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1986. 35)
 
<p>
 The Chinese filled an economic niche that few others were willing
or able to fill. Of particular importance, is that, although male
instead of female, the Chinese were permitted to assume the jobs
of domestic service (including child-care--Gee offered to undertake
child care for Florence Grohman's new-born but she decided to
hire an English nurse. (Grohman, Florence. &quot;The Yellow and
White Agony: a chapter on Western Servants&quot; in, Fifteen years'
sport and life in the hunting grounds of western America and British
Columbia. by W.A. Baillie-Grohman ; with a chapter by Mrs. Baillie-Grohman.
London: Horace Cox, 1900. 337-338); packer Ah Choy took care of
children in Lewiston between pack trips. (Trull, Fern Coble. The
history of the Chinese in Idaho from 1864 to 1910. MA thesis,
University of Oregon, June 1946. 26.)), in part because they were
ethnic minorities. The ethnic stereotyping endemic to domestic
employers was extended to the Chinese. They were awarded characteristics
that were ascribed to all servants and these were justified because
they were considered native to the Chinese. 
<blockquote>
Employer suspicion and employee theft were translated into a racial
characteristic: all Chinese or blacks or Irish were thieves. Quitting
a position, the only way to improve conditions that was available
to a servant, became a racial trait of disloyalty, and so on.
It is remarkable how interchangeable were the employer's descriptions
of the hereditary behavior of their servants. Indeed, while these
descriptions provide us with very little information about race,
they reveal a great deal about the uniformity of conditions and
relationships in domestic service.(Katzman, David M. Seven days
a week: Women and Domestic Service in Industrializing America.
New York, Oxford University Press, 1978. 222.)
</blockquote>

<p>
The universal characteristics of servants, when ascribed specifically
to the Chinese, must be viewed in the broader sense of the shared
vision of servanthood. Attributes assigned to Chinese servants
are not &quot;Chinese&quot; by nature, but are the product of
a system that systematically demeans and patronizes domestic workers.

<blockquote>
The presence of the 'inferior' domestic, an inferiority evidenced
by the performance she is encouraged to execute and her acceptance
of demeaning treatment, offers the employer justification for
materially exploiting the domestic, ego enhancement as an individual,
and a strengthening of the employer's class and racial identities.
Even more important, such a presence supports the idea of unequal
human worth: it suggests that there might be categories of people
(the lower classes, people of color) who are inherently inferior
to others (middle and upper classes, whites). And this idea provides
ideological justification for a social system that institutionalizes
inequality.(Rollins, Judith. Between Women: Domestics and their
Employers. Philadelphia, Temple University Press, 1985. 203.)

The result for the Chinese, as it has been for other domestics,
was that there was no escape from the roles assigned to them except
when they stopped being domestics. Unlike other immigrant
groups, Chinese laborers , by law and custom, generally could
not bring wives here to establish families. Thus, they were unable
to participate in what has been called one of the great &quot;defining
themes&quot; of western history, that of &quot;underclass exploitation
followed by accommodation and finally assimilation.&quot;(Powell,
Anne Elizabeth. Historic Preservation, 47:2(March/April 1995)29.) 
Nevertheless, many Chinese immigrants could rightfully be proud of their 
accomplishments as servants in Euroamerican households. Some, such as Ted 
Loy and Wing Lee, owed their later successes in the wider community to 
the skills they had perfected while adapting to an unfamiliar role within 
an alien culture.

 A brief comment about the sources used in this essay may be of
interest to those wishing to pursue this topic. In almost all
cases, the personal narratives of employers and servants were
discovered through extensive reading in primary sources; very
little of it was indexed or categorized as relating to the role
of Chinese as domestic servants. Much of it was located while
researching other topics. Florence Grohman's observations on servants
in British Columbia, entitled &quot;The Yellow and White Agony:
A Chapter on Western Servants,&quot; are appended to her husband's
reminiscences on hunting in the West. Catherine Hubback's entertaining
letters from Oakland to her family in Liverpool are at the Bodleian
Library, Oxford. Mary Julia Allen's letters to her sister from
an army post in the San Juan Islands of Puget Sound were pointed
out to me by Priscilla Wegars who acquired a photocopy of a typescript
for the Asian American Comparative Collection at the University
of Idaho. Other reminiscences have appeared in small regional
publications such as <i>The Pacific</i> and <i>Seeing Idaho </i>as
well as in local newspapers. Such sources are difficult to identify,
but rewarding when found. In addition, <i>Good Housekeeping</i>
published articles on Chinese servants in 1891 and 1896. 
<p>
There were more Chinese reminiscences available in English than
I had first suspected. Some, such as Gin Chow's, were published
in dialect by Euroamericans for their own purposes. Others, such
as Wing Yee's, resulted from conscious oral history programs.
And, too, the women who wrote of their experiences often included
biographical details as recounted by their servants.
<p>
I would expect that someone will find a great deal of information
in the manuscript census records on microfilm, in the immigration
records at the regional archives branches, and, undoubtedly, in
Chinese language sources.
<p>
All of this is meant to suggest that there is a substantial body
of research material on this and related topics that remains to
be examined and analyzed. This paper is intended only as guide
for those who might seek to expand upon it in other regions and
in other communities.<hr>
