<p>Compiled by Terry Abraham.</p>

<ol>
<li>When in doubt, throw it out.
<li>What is backlog is prologue; or, there are no temporary solutions.
<li>Garbage is garbage, no matter how long you keep it.
<li>If you've seen one archives, you've seen them all.
<li>If it doesn't fit in the box, fold it; if you can't fold it, toss it.
<li>The thoroughness of appraisal is inversely proportional to the remaining space.
<li>The value of an archives to an institution is directly proportional to the amount of natural light provided for it.
<li>Archival Rule of Threes: if a donor says he has a box to pick up, bring three; if they say they have three boxes, bring nine, and so on.
