### Project Description
The [Latah Preservation Commission (LPC)](https://latahcountyid.gov/commissions/#gsc.tab=0), a citizen commission dedicated to documenting and protecting the historic built environment of the county, publishes a physical map of historic sites and provides it as a free resource to the public. It features 90 historic locations, described in two to three sentences, and plotted on a map of the county. The University of Idaho Library's [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) department has been approached by LPC to assist with translating the physical map into a digital collection and hosting it. The Library has a track record of supporting community projects through technical services and content creation. Given the richness of the map's written content, it promises to be a useful online tool. At this time, however, the map does not include any photos of the identified sites. In order to enhance the digital collection for a variety of users, we propose augmenting the current map with both contemporary and historic photos of each location. 

{:#call}
### Call for Applications
We invite students at U of I to apply for a $4,500 fellowship that will fund the translating of LPC’s physical map of local historic sites into a digital collection and interactive map. The fellow’s scope of work would include:

1.	Take contemporary photos of each location listed on the historic sites map
2.	Gather at least one historic image of each location from Spec holdings or from a local historical group
3.	Assemble metadata for the collection, drawing heavily on the written descriptions already created by LPC
4.	Use metadata and digital images create a working map, using the CollectionBuilder framework
5.	Present site to LPC   

The fellow should plan to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week between September and December in order to accomplish the goals of the project. This award includes a $4,500 student fellowship given as a stipend and up to $500 in funds to help cover the cost of traveling to take pictures.

### Past Projects

{% capture latah_sites %}
Translated a printed map of historic sites, created by the Latah Preservation Commission, into a digital map. The original map did not include any photos, so the digital collection created through this project adds significant depth to the resource by providing both contemporary and historic photos of each location.
