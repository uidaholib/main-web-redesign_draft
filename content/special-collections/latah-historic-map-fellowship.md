### Project Description
The [Latah Preservation Commission (LPC)](https://latahcountyid.gov/commissions/#gsc.tab=0), a citizen commission dedicated to documenting and protecting the historic built environment of the county, publishes a physical map of historic sites and provides it as a free resource to the public. It features 90 historic locations, described in two to three sentences, and plotted on a map of the county. The University of Idaho Library's [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) department has been approached by LPC to assist with translating the physical map into a digital collection and hosting it. The Library has a track record of supporting community projects through technical services and content creation. Given the richness of the map's written content, it promises to be a useful online tool. At this time, however, the map does not include any photos of the identified sites. In order to enhance the digital collection for a variety of users, we propose augmenting the current map with both contemporary and historic photos of each location. 

{:#call}
### Call for Applications
We invite students at U of I to apply for a $4,500 fellowship that will fund the translating of LPC’s physical map of local historic sites into a digital collection and interactive map. The fellow’s scope of work would include:

1.	Take contemporary photos of each location listed on the historic sites map
2.	Gather at least one historic image of each location from Spec holdings or from a local historical group
3.	Assemble metadata for the collection, drawing heavily on the written descriptions already created by LPC
4.	Use metadata and digital images create a working map, using the CollectionBuilder framework
5.	Present site to LPC   

The fellow should plan to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week between September and December in order to accomplish the goals of the project. This award includes a $4,500 student fellowship given as a stipend and up to $500 in funds to help cover the cost of traveling to take pictures.
