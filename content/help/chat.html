        title3="What kind of questions can I ask via texting?" text3="Text reference is best suited to simple, fact-based questions. An appropriate question would be “How late is the library open?” or “Where are books about renaissance art?”. More complex questions may be better answered by using another of our reference formats, such as phone, e-mail, or in-person. If this is the case, you’ll receive a text asking you to continue your conversation with one of those options."
