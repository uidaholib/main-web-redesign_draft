        title3="What kind of questions can I ask via texting?" text3="Text reference is best suited to simple, fact-based questions. An appropriate question would be “How late is the library open?” or “Where are books about renaissance art?”. More complex questions may be better answered by using another of our reference formats, such as phone, e-mail, or in-person. If this is the case, you’ll receive a text asking you to continue your conversation with one of those options."
        title4="What does the service cost?" text4="You will not receive any charges from the University of Idaho for using this service, but regular charges from your cell phone provider for sending text messages still apply. The University of Idaho is not responsible or liable for any charges you may incur as a result of using this service."
