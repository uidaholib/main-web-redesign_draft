Come work with us! The University of Idaho Library employs student workers, student fellows, full-time staff, and library faculty across a range of responsibilities and disciplines.

## Student Positions

The University of Idaho Library depends heavily on student workers for both front of house and back of house positions. Student positions are part-time, with hours ranging between 8-20 hours per week that can be scheduled around classes and on evenings and weekends. Student positions are filled on a rolling basis, as needed, and work-study can be applied to most library student jobs.
