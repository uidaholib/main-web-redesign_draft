## Program FAQ

----------

### What is AI for Teaching and Learning: Higher Education?

[AI for Teaching and Learning: Higher Education](https://careercatalyst.asu.edu/programs/teaching-learning-generative-ai/) is an asynchronous, online course developed by Arizona State University that explores generative AI in the context of higher education. The course provides an overview of how these systems function and examines their pedagogical implications, including considerations related to course design, assessment, academic integrity, and student learning.

The course is designed to support faculty in developing informed perspectives and making intentional choices about how generative AI may fit within their teaching practices.

U of I’s participation in this program is funded through the Strategic Plan Investment Grant Program.

----------

### Why is this program important?

Generative AI is becoming an increasingly visible and influential part of higher education, shaping how students learn, how knowledge is created, and how teaching practices evolve. This program supports faculty in building a shared foundation for understanding generative AI, including what these technologies are, how they work, and how they can be thoughtfully engaged in teaching and learning.

By emphasizing informed and intentional engagement, the course helps faculty identify where generative AI can meaningfully support learning goals, how it intersects with disciplinary practices, and how it aligns with academic values such as rigor, integrity, and student success.

AI literacy and instructional innovation are identified priorities in the University of Idaho’s strategic plan. This program reflects the university’s commitment to preparing its academic community to engage productively and responsibly with emerging technologies in a rapidly changing educational landscape.
