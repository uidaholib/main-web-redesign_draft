## Our Library

Candidates will join an innovative and energetic workplace with an opportunity to engage in impactful librarianship, research, service, and outreach. The dynamic staff and faculty group at the University of Idaho boasts decades of experience, which has been enhanced by the recent addition of many talented user services, digital, archival, data, and research specialists. 

Our Library faculty regularly publish in top journals, present internationally at important venues, and receive significant grants from agencies including the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institution for Museum and Library Services (over $1 million in awards in recent years). Just as important, our employees are interesting, supportive, kind people dedicated to serving our community while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.   

The U of I Library is well connected in the region as a proud member of the [Orbis Cascade Alliance](https://www.orbiscascade.org/), a consortium of 39 colleges and universities across Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. We also stay connected with our academic partners throughout the state as members of the newly established [Network of Idaho Academic Libraries](https://idahoacademiclibraries.org/).

The new Instruction and User Services Librarian will join our Access & Engagement Unit, which is committed to providing point-of-need reference, research, circulation, and course reserves services to patrons. They will also join the First Year Experience Team and collaborate with colleagues to develop and offer information literacy sessions as well as connect and support students as they transition to collegiate studies and research. The day-to-day work of Access & Engagement often informs faculty research and scholarship and in spring 2025, faculty members in this unit co-facilitated a roundtable at ACRL on information literacy instruction in high school dual enrollment programs and will present at LILAC on [cooperative virtual reference](https://www.lilacconference.com/events/2025/librarians-without-borders-opportunity-and-hesitancy-in-cooperative-virtual-reference).

Faculty and staff in this unit also create and facilitate events and opportunities that foster a sense of community for our students, such as Library mini golf and [Hit the Book(s) Club](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/bookclub). These opportunities often arise through partnerships with campus offices and centers, including Housing & Residence Life, the International Programs Office, and the Center for Disability Access and Resources. 

There’s so much more to say about the U of I Library (our archival holdings, digital collections, and data and geospatial services are top notch; we collaborate across campus for almost everything we do; we have some amazing workshop series; and so much more!), but you’d probably like to know a bit more about the University of Idaho.

## Our University

Candidates will enter the university at an exciting point in its over 130-year old lifespan, with the previous three years seeing the three largest first-year student classes in university history. For the fifth year in a row, the university has been ranked as the “Best Value Public University in the West” by U.S. News and World Report and second in the nation among public colleges. Furthermore, in 2025 we became the [first and only university in Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/ui/carnegie-r1) to achieve the highest level of classification for research activity (R1) as determined by the Carnegie Classification.

In addition to being the leading research institution in the state, the university is also a land-grant institution, with [46 extension centers](https://www.uidaho.edu/extension) in 42 of Idaho’s 44 counties. These centers support researchers, educators, and specialists in the disciplines of forestry and natural resources, horticulture, aquaculture, and much more, in a long-standing effort to empower youth and develop communities across Idaho.

## Our Community

Moscow is located in north Idaho, just 10 minutes away from Pullman, Washington (home to [another major university](https://wsu.edu/)) and an hour and half from Spokane and Coeur d’Alene. The University of Idaho is at the heart of the community, and Moscow benefits from a diverse workforce and community commitment to education. The town’s nickname is the “Heart of the Arts,” and for good reason.

There are enough outdoor recreation opportunities to keep every hiker, [mountain biker](https://mambatrails.org/), and angler happy. Moscow’s summers are particularly special, with a nationally recognized [Farmers Market](https://www.ci.moscow.id.us/197/Community-Events-Division-Moscow-Farmers) each weekend and a number of community festivals throughout the season.
