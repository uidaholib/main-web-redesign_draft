The Library hosts workshops designed to promote awareness, build skills, and educate the University of Idaho community on issues associated with research and learning in the information age. 
We are committed to creating a welcoming, supportive, and engaging environment for everyone to learn and build research skills. All events are free and open to the greater university community.

Materials and information about past workshops can be found on our <a href="{{ '/services/workshops/resources.html' | relative_url }}">Resources page</a>.
