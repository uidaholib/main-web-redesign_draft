## Call for Applications

The University of Idaho Library invites students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for the Berry International Jazz Collections Fellowship. 
This program funds one student each year to collaborate with the faculty and staff at the University of Idaho Library to increase the visibility and use of the [International Jazz Collections (IJC)](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) through work on a specific research project. 
Research should focus on the primary sources in the IJC, and applicants are encouraged to think creatively about the format of their research output. 
[Past projects](#past) have taken the form of digital collections, oral histories, physical archival exhibits, and digital essays created with the guidance of Library staff.

The applicant may base their research on any [IJC collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/). 
Not sure where to begin? 
See the the abbreviated [list of collections](#coll) below for project ideas.

The fellowship will conclude with an exhibition of the student's work at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival as part of the Library's International Jazz Collection exhibits. 

The fellow should plan to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week between January and April in order to accomplish the goals of the project. This award includes a $4,000 student fellowship given as a stipend and up to $500 in research funds to help cover the cost of materials and supplies, project-related travel expenses, etc.
