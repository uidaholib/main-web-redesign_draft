## Call for Applications

The Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning invites graduate students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for a CDIL Graduate Fellowship to work with CDIL staff on a project of their design/choosing and/or on ongoing projects in the CDIL.

This fellowship offers **$4,000** to support graduate students during a 10-week summer program to work directly with CDIL staff to build their own expertise and skills in digital scholarship via the creation, revision, or promotion of new or extant digital projects.
This is a flexible program guided by the interests and unique research of each fellow.
Note that most fellows continue to work with CDIL staff over the course of the following year as well. 

### Expectations

Fellows will be expected to work and meet at the CDIL and virtually while developing the project over the summer months (mid-May to mid-August). During the fall semester, the fellow will present their work in the CDIL, either as a traditional presentation, a workshop, or via a U of I Library online publication.
The stipend is awarded in two intervals, with the majority provided up front and the rest after presentation of the project in the following semester. 

### About CDIL
