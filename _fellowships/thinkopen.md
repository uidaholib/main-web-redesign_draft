Think Open Fellowships were designed to support faculty in adopting Open Educational Resources (OER) in the courses they teach. The Think Open Fellowship program was intended to reduce barriers to student success by supporting the use of low or no‐cost course materials in place of traditional textbooks. 

Sunset in 2025, The Think Open Fellowship saved University of Idaho students over $500,000 in costs over the course of its activity.
