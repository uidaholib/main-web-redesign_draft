## Call for Applications

The Center for Digital Inquiry & Learning (CDIL) invites U of I faculty members to apply for a CDIL Faculty Development Fellowship when they have a need/desire to develop more digital scholarship skills to enhance their teaching, research, and/or open publishing. The fellowship is open on a rolling basis, but is typically limited by the capacity of CDIL Faculty to 1-2 a year.

This fellowship offers **$1,500** to support faculty in developing their digital scholarship capabilities. The CDIL Faculty Development Fellowship provides customized learning experiences that may include:

- **Digital Project Development** - Learn to conceptualize and plan digital scholarship projects
- **Data Visualization** - Develop skills in creating compelling visual representations of research data
- **Web Development** - Gain experience with modern web technologies for academic publishing
- **Digital Archives and Collections** - Understand best practices for digital curation and preservation
- **Collaborative Digital Scholarship** - Learn to work effectively in interdisciplinary digital teams
- **Open Publishing and OER** - Explore platforms, tools, and approaches to impact scholarship and learning
- **Tool Training** - Hands-on experience with digital scholarship tools and platforms

The Digital Scholarship Development Fellowship recipient will meet with CDIL staff for 3 to 5 training sessions and project development meetings throughout one semester. The specific content of these sessions will be tailored according to the fellow's research interests during an initial planning meeting with CDIL staff.

As a final outcome, development fellows will publish a (prototype) digital project, present a public session to share their work with the U of I community, or submit a formal project proposal following a grant application structure for CDIL staff to review.
