## Call for Applications

The University of Idaho Library invites graduate students from any discipline at the University of Idaho to apply for the Julie and David Levine Data Hub Fellowship. 

The fellowship occurs during the Spring semester with exact dates to be negotiated with the successful applicant. The fellow should plan to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week on the project. Eligible applicants must be enrolled in the spring semester.

In addition to helping with the operation of the Data Hub, fellows will select or propose a project which forwards the goals of increasing the availability of collections or services in support of the U of I Library's Data Hub.

**Potential Projects:**

- Identify, prioritize, digitize, and georeference historical aerial imagery of Idaho. The U of I Library manages a large printed aerial photo collection. A project would be to identify and understand items in the printed aerial photo collection, prioritize unique items, and digitize and georeference items to make them more accessible and useable for use by students, researchers, or others.
- Identify and digitize historical data resources relevant to Idaho. University of Idaho physical and digital collections contains numerous sources of tabular and other forms of data, locked in either physical volumes or as scanned PDF documents.  A project would be to identify a dataset across a series of publications, either physical or digital and convert those to useable, contemporary datasets for use by students, researchers, or others.
- Create curated learning paths for topics in GIS or the data sciences of a particular discipline. The Library seeks to support learning of data literacy across campus as well as development of open educational resources that can impact teaching. As initiatives such as Data Carpentry workshops and increased focus on data sciences in course work take root at U of I, how can the library help curate resources and provide support for learners in specific areas of data literacy? A potential fellow project would pursue this question, helping to curate resources, develop teaching materials, and deliver programming to meet the needs of the campus community.

The deliverables from the fellowship project will be online resources such as digitized and geo-rectified aerial imagery, data sciences-related learning materials, or digitized and normalized data resources derived from historical material. A multi-modal report documenting the process and resources will be expected as part of the conclusion of the fellowship. All deliverables will be made publicly available through the U of I Library website and other sites as appropriate (e.g. Github).
