## Call for Applications

Library Seed Grants support research and outreach projects in their nascent stages. These grants are intended to seed a project; in other words, we are looking to support projects that have the potential to grow and garner additional grant funds. Library Seed Grants must utilize the library's collections and/or staff member expertise in order to qualify. Preference is given to projects that create collaborative partnerships between the library and campus stakeholders.
