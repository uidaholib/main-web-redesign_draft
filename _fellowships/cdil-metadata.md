## Call for Applications

The Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning invites undergraduate or graduate students currently enrolled in any University of Idaho program to work with CDIL staff to create compliant metadata to describe and make accessible a collection of approximately 750 newspaper articles authored by Idaho journalist and U of I alum Ben J. Plastino. The fellow will learn to use AI to assist with the creation of succinct descriptions of each article, and will then apply critical reasoning to appropriately tag the article with a controlled vocabulary.

Fellows will be expected to work at the CDIL or virtually while creating metadata that complies with the standards set forth by their supervisor. At the conclusion of the project, the fellow will reflect on their experience in a blog post that will be shared on the Library’s Harvester platform.

This fellowship offers **$2,000** to support the student fellow as they complete the metadata project over the course of the Fall 2025 semester. The stipend is supported by the family of Ben J. Plastino.
